Instead of needing AR tokens to pay for storage, you can use Turbo Credits that can be purchased with fiat currency or various cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and more.

The service also handles all the technical complexity of bundling transactions and ensures your data is properly stored on Arweave."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Turbo provides both SDK and CLI tools for different use cases.
