# AR.IO Documentation

AR.IO Documentation is a Next.js site built with Fumadocs that hosts the product and developer documentation for the AR.IO network and tooling. It contains authored guides, API references, and autogenerated content sourced from scripts in this repository.

## Docs Site

Visit [docs.ar.io](https://docs.ar.io) for the published version of these docs.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to preview the site locally.

## Project Structure Highlights

- `lib/source.ts`: Content source adapterâ€”`loader()` exposes the headless content interface.
- `lib/layout.shared.tsx`: Shared layout options reused across routes.
- `app/(home)`: Landing page and supporting marketing pages.
- `app/docs`: Documentation layout and pages.
- `app/api/search/route.ts`: Route handler powering on-site search.

## Contributing

### Building the docs

1. Install dependencies with your preferred package manager (`npm install`, `pnpm install`, or `yarn install`).
2. Run the local development server using the commands above and confirm changes at http://localhost:3000.
3. When ready for production, build the static output with `npm run build` (or the equivalent `pnpm`/`yarn` command).

### Content generation scripts

Automated content is produced through the scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

- `generate-api-docs.ts`: Generates OpenAPI-driven API documentation pages.
- `generate-sdk-docs.ts`: Builds SDK reference docs from source annotations.
- `generate-llm-text.js` and `generate-sdk-llm-texts.js`: Create AI-assisted text snippets for docs and SDK references.
- `deploy-to-arweave.js`: Publishes the built site to Arweave storage.
- `check-links.mjs`: Validates internal and external links within the generated site.

Refer to `scripts/README-llm-generation.md` for additional details on generating LLM-assisted content.
