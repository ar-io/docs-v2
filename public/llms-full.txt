# Arweave Name System (ArNS) (/build/access/arns)

ArNS provides **human-readable URLs** for your Arweave data, making it easy to share and remember permanent addresses.

## What is ArNS?

ArNS is a naming system that allows you to register human-readable names that point to your Arweave transactions. Instead of sharing long transaction IDs, you can use memorable URLs.

**Example:**

- **Before:** `https://arweave.net/bVLEkL1SOPFCzIYi8T_QNnh17VlDp4RylU6YTwCMVRw`
- **After:** `https://myapp.arweave.net`

  **Learn More:** For detailed information about ArNS architecture and how it works, see our [ArNS Documentation](/learn/arns).

## Get an ArNS Name

The easiest way to get an ArNS name is via [arns.ar.io](https://arns.ar.io), which supports multiple payment methods:

- **Fiat payments** - Credit cards and bank transfers
- **Turbo Credits** - Use existing Turbo credits
- **ARIO tokens** - Pay with ARIO cryptocurrency

**Alternative registration methods:**

- **[Wander Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wander)** - Browser-based registration
- **Wander Mobile App** - Register on iOS and Android
- **AR.IO SDK** - Programmatic registration using the `buyRecord` API

### Using the AR.IO SDK

For developers, you can register ArNS names programmatically:

```js

const ario = ARIO.mainnet();

// Buy a record with Turbo Credits or ARIO tokens
const result = await ario.buyRecord({
  name: 'my-domain',
  years: 1,
  // Payment method: 'turbo-credits' or 'ario-tokens'
});

console.log('Record purchased:', result);
```

  **Learn More:** For a complete list of AR.IO SDK APIs, see the [ArNS SDK Documentation](/sdks/ar-io-sdk/arweave-name-system-arns).

## Fetching Data via ArNS

Once you've set up your ArNS name, fetch data using standard HTTP requests:

```js
// Fetch content from your ArNS name
const response = await fetch("https://my-data.arweave.net");

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}

const data = await response.text();
console.log(data);
```

## Why Use ArNS?

ArNS provides significant advantages for accessing data on Arweave:

**Decentralized Data Index**
- ArNS creates a decentralized index of data accessible through any gateway in the AR.IO network
- No single point of failure - names resolve across all participating gateways
- Censorship-resistant access to your content

**Flexible Data Management**
- **Permanent references** - Keep stable URLs even when updating underlying data
- **Replaceable data** - Point names to new transaction IDs as content evolves
- **Undernames** - Organize related content under a single name using underscores (e.g., `v2_myapp.arweave.net`, `docs_myapp.arweave.net`)

**Supporting Network Decentralization**
- ArNS purchases contribute to the protocol balance
- Fees reward AR.IO gateway operators for participating in the network
- This economic model preserves decentralized access to data on Arweave
- Your name registration helps maintain the infrastructure that serves your content

# Fetch Data (via REST API) (/build/access/fetch-data)

The simplest way to access data on Arweave is through **HTTP requests** to gateways. This method works in any web browser and requires no additional setup.

## Fetching Data from Gateways

Gateways are the most performant way to fetch data from Arweave, providing significant advantages over accessing Arweave nodes directly.

**Why Gateways Are Faster:**

- **Content Caching** - Pre-cached data for instant retrieval
- **Data Indexing** - Fast search and query capabilities
- **Network Optimization** - Distributed infrastructure for better performance
- **Content Delivery** - Optimized serving with compression and CDN features

## REST APIs for Fetching Data

Gateways support multiple API endpoints for accessing data:

### Standard Endpoint

Access any transaction using this URL structure:

```
https:///
```

**Examples:**

- `https://arweave.net/bVLEkL1SOPFCzIYi8T_QNnh17VlDp4RylU6YTwCMVRw`
- `https://permagate.io/FguFk5eSth0wO8SKfziYshkSxeIYe7oK9zoPN2PhSc0`

### Raw Data Endpoint

For raw data access that bypasses manifest path resolution:

```
https:///raw/
```

This endpoint returns the raw data bytes without resolving manifest paths, useful when you need the exact stored data.

  **Learn More:** For complete API documentation and testing, see the [AR.IO
  Node Data APIs](/apis/ar-io-node/data).

## Sandboxing

AR.IO gateways implement security measures by redirecting requests to sandbox subdomains for enhanced browser security.

**Why Redirects Happen:**

- **Security Isolation** - Content is served from isolated sandbox environments
- **CSP Protection** - Prevents cross-site scripting attacks
- **Resource Isolation** - Limits potential security vulnerabilities
- **Browser Sandboxing** - Leverages same-origin policy for enhanced security

**What to Expect:**

- Initial request: `https://arweave.net/transaction-id`
- Redirects to: `https://sandbox.arweave.net/transaction-id` (or similar)
- Final content served from sandbox subdomain

**Important:** Always follow redirects in your applications - the final sandbox URL contains the actual content.

  **Learn More:** For detailed information about how browser sandboxing works
  and why it's important for security, see our [Browser
  Sandboxing](/build/advanced/sandboxing) documentation.

## Using in Applications

**JavaScript Example with Fetch:**

```js
// Fetch data from Arweave (follows redirects automatically)
const response = await fetch("https://arweave.net/your-transaction-id", {
  redirect: "follow", // Follow redirects automatically
});

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}

const data = await response.text();
console.log(data);
```

**HTML Example:**

```html

```

## Manifests

For organized file collections, use manifests to create friendly path-based URLs:

```
https://arweave.net//path/to/file
```

**Example:**

- `https://arweave.net/X8Qm…AOhA/index.html`
- `https://arweave.net/X8Qm…AOhA/styles.css`
- `https://arweave.net/X8Qm…AOhA/assets/logo.png`

# Find Data (via GraphQL) (/build/access/find-data)

Use **GraphQL** to **find and identify** Arweave data with powerful search and filtering capabilities. GraphQL is used for discovery - you query to get transaction IDs, then use those IDs to fetch the actual data.

  **GraphQL is for Discovery, Not Direct Access** GraphQL finds data, it doesn't
  access it directly. Use GraphQL to get transaction IDs, then use those IDs
  with the REST API to fetch the actual data.

## How GraphQL Works

GraphQL on Arweave follows a two-step process:

1. **Find** - Query GraphQL to discover transactions by tags, metadata, owner, or other criteria
2. **Fetch** - Use the transaction IDs from your query results to retrieve the actual data via the REST API

This separation allows for powerful data discovery while keeping data retrieval fast and efficient.

## GraphQL Providers

- **arweave.net** - `https://arweave.net/graphql` - Comprehensive indexing of all Arweave data
- **Goldsky** - `https://arweave-search.goldsky.com/graphql` - High-performance GraphQL service with full data coverage

  **AR.IO Gateways:** AR.IO gateways support the `/graphql` endpoint, but they
  only return data they've indexed. If you're uploading data and want it
  unbundled and indexed, you can run a gateway and configure it to unbundle your
  data, or post data items/bundles via the gateway's APIs (recommended). [Learn
  more](/build/run-a-gateway/manage/filters).

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is using the interactive GraphQL playground:

1. Navigate to [https://arweave.net/graphql](https://arweave.net/graphql) in your browser
2. Enter your GraphQL query in the interface
3. Press the "play" button to execute and see results

## Basic Query Structure

Try this example query in the playground - it fetches the most recent 10 HTML pages from "MyApp":

```graphql
query {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", values: ["text/html"] }
      { name: "App-Name", values: ["MyApp"] }
    ]
    sort: HEIGHT_DESC
    first: 10
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
        data {
          size
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Queries

    Here's how to find videos using GraphQL:

    ```js
    const query = `
      query {
        transactions(
          tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", values: ["video/mp4"] }]
          first: 10
        ) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              tags {
                name
                value
              }
              data {
                size
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `;

    const response = await fetch("https://arweave.net/graphql", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ query }),
    });

    const data = await response.json();
    const videos = data.data.transactions.edges;

    // This returns transaction IDs that you can use with HTTP requests
    console.log(
      "Found video IDs:",
      videos.map((v) => v.node.id)
    );
    ```

    ```js
    const query = `
      query {
        transactions(owners: ["your-wallet-address"], first: 10) {

              hasNextPage
            }
            edges {
              cursor
              node {
                id
                tags {
                  name
                  value
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      `;

      const nextResponse = await fetch("https://arweave.net/graphql", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          query: nextQuery,
          variables: { cursor: edges[edges.length - 1].cursor },
        }),
      });

      const nextData = await nextResponse.json();
      console.log(nextData.data);
    }
    ```

## Pagination

As of September 2025, GraphQL endpoints have different limits:

- **arweave.net**: Supports queries up to **1,000 items at once**
- **Goldsky**: Supports queries up to **100 items at once**

For larger datasets, use cursor-based pagination to navigate through results.

**How Pagination Works:**

- Use `first` parameter to specify page size (max 1,000 for arweave.net, max 100 for Goldsky)
- Use `pageInfo.hasNextPage` to check if more results exist
- Use `cursor` from the last item with `after` parameter for the next page

```js
let allTransactions = [];
let hasNextPage = true;
let cursor = null;

while (hasNextPage) {
  const query = `
    query($cursor: String) {
      transactions(
        tags: [{ name: "App-Name", values: ["MyApp"] }]
        first: 100
        ${cursor ? "after: $cursor" : ""}
      ) {
        pageInfo {
          hasNextPage
        }
        edges {
          cursor
          node {
            id
            tags {
              name
              value
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `;

  const response = await fetch("https://arweave.net/graphql", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      query,
      variables: cursor ? { cursor } : {},
    }),
  });

  const data = await response.json();
  const { edges, pageInfo } = data.data.transactions;

  allTransactions.push(...edges);
  hasNextPage = pageInfo.hasNextPage;
  cursor = edges.length > 0 ? edges[edges.length - 1].cursor : null;

  console.log(
    `Loaded ${edges.length} transactions. Total: ${allTransactions.length}`
  );
}

console.log(`Found ${allTransactions.length} total transactions`);
```

## Query Optimization Tips

Follow these guidelines for optimal performance:

**Specificity:**

- Use the most precise tags possible to narrow search scope
- Query with essential tags only to reduce processing time

**Schema Design:**

- Design your app's schema to reflect query patterns
- Use tags that encapsulate frequent combinations of criteria

**Include Non-tag Fields:**

- Add fields like `owner` to refine your search
- This makes queries more efficient and targeted

**Order Your Tags:**

- Arrange tags from most specific to most general
- This leverages Arweave's indexing more effectively

**Example Optimized Query:**

```js
// Well-optimized query with specific tags and useful fields
const query = `
  query {
    transactions(
      tags: [
        { name: "App-Name", values: ["MyApp"] }
        { name: "Content-Type", values: ["application/json"] }
        { name: "Version", values: ["1.0"] }
      ]
      owners: ["your-wallet-address"]
      first: 20
    ) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          data {
            size
            type
          }
          tags {
            name
            value
          }
          block {
            height
            timestamp
          }
          owner {
            address
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

# Access Data (/build/access)

Once data is stored on Arweave, it's permanently available. Here's how to access it efficiently for your applications.

## Access Methods

Different methods serve different needs. Each provides unique capabilities for retrieving data from Arweave.

        Search and discover data on Arweave
        
           Query by tags and metadata
           Filter by app, owner, timestamp
           Get transaction IDs for fetching

    }
    href="/build/access/find-data"
    icon={}
  />
  
        Retrieve data bytes from Arweave
        
           REST API endpoints
           GET arweave.net/[txId]
           Returns raw data/files

    }
    href="/build/access/fetch-data"
    icon={}
  />
  
        Assign names to data and apps
        
           Create names like ardrive.ar.io
           Point to any Arweave data
           Update targets as needed

    }
    href="/build/access/arns"
    icon={}
  />

## Common Access Patterns

**Finding Data**
- Search for data by tags, owner, or timestamp
- Discover content from specific applications
- Get transaction IDs for data retrieval

**Fetching Data**
- Retrieve the actual files/data using transaction IDs
- Access data via REST API: `GET arweave.net/[txId]`
- Stream large files efficiently

**Naming with ArNS**
- Register memorable names for your apps and data
- Create permanent links like `ardrive.ar.io`
- Update where names point without changing the URL

## Quick Example: Find and Fetch

### Find Data
Use GraphQL to search for data and get transaction IDs:

```graphql
query {
  transactions(
    tags: [{ name: "App-Name", values: ["ArDrive"] }]
    first: 1
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetch Data
Use the transaction ID to retrieve the actual data:

```bash
curl https://arweave.net/[transaction-id-from-above]
```

# Creating Drives (/build/advanced/arfs/creating-drives)

To properly create a new drive, two new entities need to be created: a new Drive entity and a new Folder entity to serve as the root folder of that drive.

## New Drive Entity

- The user must specify a `name` of the drive which is stored within the Drive Entity's metadata JSON.
- ArDrive generates a new unique uuidv4 for the drive entity's `Drive-Id`.
- ArDrive also generates a new unique uuidv4 for the drive entity's `rootFolderId`, which will refer to the `Folder-Id` of the new folder entity that will be created.
  - This `rootFolderId` is stored within the Drive Entity's metadata JSON.
- Drive Entity Metadata transactions must have `Entity-Type: "drive"`.
- ArDrive will that the current local system time as seconds since Unix epoch for the Drive Entity's `Unix-Time`.
- The Drive Entity's `Drive-Privacy` must also be set to `public` or `private` in order for its subfolders and files to have the correct security settings.
- If the drive is private:
  - Its `Cipher` tag must be filled out with the correct encryption algorithm (currently `AES256-GCM`).
  - Its `Cipher-IV` tag must be filled out with the generated Initialization Vector for the private drive.
  - The ArFS client must derive the Drive Key and encrypt the Drive Entity's metadata JSON using the assigned `Cipher` and `Cipher-IV`.

## New Root Folder Entity

- The `name` of the drive and folder entities must be the same.
  - This `name` is stored within the Folder Entity's metadata JSON.
- The Folder Entity's `Folder-Id` must match the `rootFolderId` previously created for the Drive Entity.
- The Folder Entity's `Drive-Id` must match the `Drive-Id` previously created for the Drive Entity.
- The Folder Entity must not include a `Parent-Folder-Id` tag.
  - This is how it is determined to be the root folder for a drive.
- Folder Entity metadata transactions must have `Entity-Type: 'folder'`.
- The client gets the user's local time for the `Unix-Time` tag, represented as seconds since Unix Epoch.
- Public folders must have the content type `Content-Type: "application/json"`.
- If the folder is private
  - Its `Cipher` tag must be filled out with the correct encryption algorithm (currently `AES256-GCM`).
  - Its `Cipher-IV` tag must be filled out with the generated Initialization Vector for the private folder.
  - Its content type must be `Content-Type: "application/octet-stream"`.
  - The ArFS client must encrypt the Drive Entity's metadata JSON using the assigned `Cipher` and `Cipher-IV`.

## Creating Files

Files in ArFS require two separate transactions:

1. **File Metadata Transaction** - Contains file information and references
2. **File Data Transaction** - Contains the actual file data

### File Metadata Transaction

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
Drive-Id: "",
Entity-Type: "file",
File-Id: "",
Parent-Folder-Id: "",
Unix-Time: ""

Metadata JSON {
    "name": "",
    "size": ,
    "lastModifiedDate": ,
    "dataTxId": "",
    "dataContentType": "",
    "isHidden": false,
    "pinnedDataOwner": ""
}
```

### File Data Transaction

```json
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
{ File Data - Encrypted if private }
```

## Creating Folders

Folders are simpler than files as they only require a metadata transaction:

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
Drive-Id: "",
Entity-Type: "folder",
Folder-Id: "",
Parent-Folder-Id?: "",
Unix-Time: ""

Metadata JSON {
    "name": "",
    "isHidden": false
}
```

## Creating Snapshots

Snapshots provide a way to quickly synchronize drive state by rolling up all metadata into a single transaction:

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Drive-Id: "",
Entity-Type: "snapshot",
Snapshot-Id: "",
Content-Type: "",
Block-Start: "",
Block-End: "",
Data-Start: "",
Data-End: "",
Unix-Time: ""
```

## Implementation Example

Here's a practical example of creating a complete drive structure:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Wallet
    participant Arweave

    User->>Client: Create drive "My Project"
    Client->>Client: Generate drive UUID
    Client->>Client: Generate root folder UUID
    Client->>Wallet: Request signature (if private)
    Wallet->>Client: Return signature
    Client->>Client: Derive drive key (if private)
    Client->>Client: Encrypt metadata (if private)
    Client->>Arweave: Upload drive entity
    Client->>Arweave: Upload root folder entity

    User->>Client: Create folder "Documents"
    Client->>Client: Generate folder UUID
    Client->>Client: Encrypt folder metadata (if private)
    Client->>Arweave: Upload folder entity

    User->>Client: Upload file "readme.txt"
    Client->>Client: Generate file UUID
    Client->>Client: Encrypt file metadata (if private)
    Client->>Client: Encrypt file data (if private)
    Client->>Arweave: Upload file metadata
    Client->>Arweave: Upload file data
```

## Best Practices

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for drives, folders, and files
- Avoid special characters that might cause issues
- Keep names under 255 characters
- Use consistent casing

### Organization

- Create logical folder structures
- Use meaningful folder names
- Implement proper versioning
- Document your structure

### Performance

- Batch operations when possible
- Use efficient queries
- Implement caching
- Consider file sizes

### Security

- Use strong passwords for private drives
- Implement proper key management
- Follow encryption best practices
- Regular security audits

## Error Handling

When creating ArFS entities, handle these common scenarios:

### Transaction Failures

- Implement retry logic for failed uploads
- Validate data before uploading
- Check transaction confirmation status

### Validation Errors

- Verify required tags are present
- Check data format compliance
- Validate UUID formats

### Network Issues

- Implement timeout handling
- Provide user feedback
- Graceful degradation

## Next Steps

Now that you know how to create ArFS entities, learn how to work with them:

- [Reading Data](/build/advanced/arfs/reading-data) - Query and retrieve your ArFS data
- [Privacy & Encryption](/build/advanced/arfs/privacy) - Secure your data with private drives
- [Upgrading Private Drives](/build/advanced/arfs/upgrading-drives) - Update legacy drives to v0.15

# Data Model (/build/advanced/arfs/data-model)

Because of Arweave's permanent and immutable nature, traditional file structure operations such as renaming and moving files or folders cannot be accomplished by simply updating on-chain data. ArFS works around this by defining an append-only transaction data model based on the metadata tags found in the Arweave [Transaction Headers.](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/server/http-api#transaction-format)

This model uses a bottom-up reference method, which avoids race conditions in file system updates. Each file contains metadata that refers to the parent folder, and each folder contains metadata that refers to its parent drive. A top-down data model would require the parent model (i.e. a folder) to store references to its children.

These defined entities allow the state of the drive to be constructed by a client to look and feel like a file system:

- Drive Entities contain folders and files
- Folder Entities contain other folders or files
- File Entities contain both the file data and metadata
- Snapshot entities contain a state rollups of all entities' (such as drive, folder, file and snapshot) metadata within a drive

## Entity Relationships

The following diagram shows the high level relationships between drive, folder, and file entities, and their associated data. More detailed information about each Entity Type can be found in the ArFS specification documentation.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Drive Entity] --> B[Root Folder]
    B --> C[Subfolder 1]
    B --> D[Subfolder 2]
    B --> E[File 1]
    C --> F[File 2]
    C --> G[File 3]
    D --> H[File 4]
    D --> I[Subfolder 3]
    I --> J[File 5]

    A --> K[Drive Metadata]
    B --> L[Folder Metadata]
    C --> M[Folder Metadata]
    D --> N[Folder Metadata]
    I --> O[Folder Metadata]
    E --> P[File Metadata + Data]
    F --> Q[File Metadata + Data]
    G --> R[File Metadata + Data]
    H --> S[File Metadata + Data]
    J --> T[File Metadata + Data]

    U[Snapshot Entity] --> V[Complete Drive State]
    V --> A
    V --> B
    V --> C
    V --> D
    V --> I
    V --> E
    V --> F
    V --> G
    V --> H
    V --> J
```

As you can see, each file and folder contains metadata which points to both the parent folder and the parent drive. The drive entity contains metadata about itself, but not the child contents. So clients must build drive states from the lowest level and work their way up.

## Metadata Format

Metadata stored in any Arweave transaction tag will be defined in the following manner:

```json
{ "name": "Example-Tag", "value": "example-data" }
```

Metadata stored in the Transaction Data Payload will follow JSON formatting like below:

```json
{
  "exampleField": "exampleData"
}
```

Fields with a `?` suffix are optional.

```json
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "description": "This is a sample project.",
  "version?": "1.0.0",
  "author?": "John Doe"
}
```

Enumerated field values (those which must adhere to certain values) are defined in the format "value 1 | value 2".

All UUIDs used for Entity-Ids are based on the [Universally Unique Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) standard.

There are no requirements to list ArFS tags in any specific order.

## Building Drive State

To construct the current state of a drive, clients must:

1. **Query for all entities** associated with a specific `Drive-Id`
2. **Sort by block height** to establish chronological order
3. **Process entities bottom-up** starting with files and folders
4. **Build the hierarchy** by following parent-child relationships
5. **Handle conflicts** by using the most recent entity version

### Example Drive State Construction

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway
    participant Arweave

    Client->>Gateway: Query Drive-Id: abc123
    Gateway->>Client: Return all entities

    Client->>Client: Sort by block height
    Client->>Client: Process files first
    Client->>Client: Process folders
    Client->>Client: Process drive metadata
    Client->>Client: Build hierarchy tree
    Client->>Client: Resolve conflicts
    Client->>Client: Return complete drive state
```

## Entity Lifecycle

Each ArFS entity follows a specific lifecycle pattern:

### Creation

1. Generate unique UUID for entity
2. Create metadata transaction with required tags
3. For files: create separate data transaction
4. Upload to Arweave network

### Updates

1. Create new entity with same ID
2. Update metadata as needed
3. Upload new transaction
4. Client processes both versions and uses latest

### Deletion

1. Mark entity as hidden (`isHidden: true`)
2. Upload new transaction
3. Entity remains in history but hidden from UI

## Data Integrity

ArFS ensures data integrity through:

- **Immutable transactions** - Once uploaded, data cannot be modified
- **Cryptographic signatures** - All transactions are signed by the owner
- **Version tracking** - Multiple versions of entities can exist
- **Conflict resolution** - Clients use block height and timestamps to resolve conflicts

## Performance Considerations

For large drives, consider these optimization strategies:

- **Use snapshots** for quick state reconstruction
- **Implement caching** for frequently accessed data
- **Batch operations** when possible
- **Query by date ranges** to limit data transfer

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the ArFS data model, learn how to work with it:

- [Privacy & Encryption](/build/advanced/arfs/privacy) - Secure your data with private drives
- [Creating Drives](/build/advanced/arfs/creating-drives) - Start building with ArFS
- [Reading Data](/build/advanced/arfs/reading-data) - Query and retrieve your data

# Entity Types (/build/advanced/arfs/entity-types)

## Overview

Arweave transactions provide for a separation between data and metadata about that data via the use of headers. Key-value tags in the headers provide for expressive description about the data as well as searchability via gateway GraphQL APIs.

ArFS adds an additional layer of separation between data and metadata by using separate transactions for ArFS metadata and, where applicable, ArFS file data. But it also makes use of tags and data separation within an ArFS metadata transaction by including data critical to tracking drive composition in the tags space of ArFS metadata transactions and having most of the other metadata encoded as JSON in the data body of the metadata transaction. In the case of private entities, JSON data and file data payloads are always encrypted according to the protocol processes defined below.

- Drive entities require a single metadata transaction, with standard Drive tags and encoded JSON with secondary metadata.

- Folder entities require a single metadata transaction, with standard Folder tags and an encoded JSON with secondary metadata.

- File entities require a metadata transaction, with standard File tags and an encoded Data JSON with secondary metadata relating to the file.

- File entities also require a second data transaction, which includes a limited set of File tags and the actual file data itself.

- Snapshot entities require a single transaction, which contains a Data JSON with all of the Drive's rolled up ArFS metadata and standard Snapshot GQL tags that identify the Snapshot.

ArFS v0.14 introduces the `isHidden` property. `isHidden` is a boolean (true/false) that tells clients if they should display the file or folder. Hidden files still exist and will be included in [snapshots](#snapshot), but should not be rendered by clients. If `isHidden` is not present, its value should be assumed false.

ArFS v0.15 introduces the `Signature-Type` metadata property on Drive entities, and a new entity type `DriveSignature`.

## Drive

A drive is the highest level logical grouping of folders and files. All folders and files must be part of a drive, and reference the Drive ID of that drive.

When creating a Drive, a corresponding "root" folder must be created as well. This separation of drive and folder entity enables features such as folder view queries, renaming, and linking.

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
Drive-Id: "",
Drive-Privacy: "",
Drive-Auth-Mode?: "password",
Entity-Type: "drive",
Signature-Type?: "1",
Unix-Time: ""

Metadata JSON {
    "name": "",
    "rootFolderId": "",
    "isHidden": false
}
```

## Drive-Signature

ArFS versions prior to v0.15 applied encryption to drive contents with a signing scheme that, while secure, is now deprecated in modern Arweave software wallets. ArFS v0.15 introduces an updated signing scheme compatible with these wallets and as well as "Drive Signatures", a new entity type to help bridge the signature derivation schemes across ArFS versions.

A drive signature uses the v0.15 encryption scheme to encrypt and store the pre-v0.15 wallet signature for a private drive that is necessary for deriving the "drive key" for that drive. This allows for continued access of historical drive contents into the future.

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Entity-Type: "drive-signature",
Signature-Format: "1",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV: ""
{data: }
```

The encrypted "type 1" signature for the drive must be provided in the `data` field of the transaction creating the drive-signature entity.

## Folder

A folder is a logical grouping of other folders and files. Folder entity metadata transactions without a parent folder id are considered the Drive Root Folder of their corresponding Drives. All other Folder entities must have a parent folder id. Since folders do not have underlying data, there is no Folder data transaction required.

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
Drive-Id: "",
Entity-Type: "folder",
Folder-Id: "",
Parent-Folder-Id?: "",
Unix-Time: ""

Metadata JSON {
    "name": "",
    "isHidden": false
}
```

## File

A File contains uploaded data, like a photo, document, or movie.

In the Arweave File System, a single file is broken into 2 parts - its metadata and its data.

A File entity metadata transaction does not include the actual File data. Instead, the File data must be uploaded as a separate transaction, called the File Data Transaction. The File JSON metadata transaction contains a reference to the File Data Transaction ID so that it can retrieve the actual data. This separation allows for file metadata to be updated without requiring the file itself to be reuploaded. It also ensures that private files can have their JSON Metadata Transaction encrypted as well, ensuring that no one without authorization can see either the file or its metadata.

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
Drive-Id: "",
Entity-Type: "file",
File-Id: "",
Parent-Folder-Id: "",
Unix-Time: ""

Metadata JSON {
    "name": "",
    "size": ,
    "lastModifiedDate": ,
    "dataTxId": "",
    "dataContentType": "",
    "isHidden": false,
    "pinnedDataOwner": "", # Optional
}
```

### Pinning Files

Since the version v0.13, ArFS supports Pins. Pins are files whose data may be any transaction uploaded to Arweave, that may or may not be owned by the wallet that created the pin.

When a new File Pin is created, the only created transaction is the Metadata Transaction. The `dataTxId` field will point it to any transaction in Arweave, and the optional `pinnedDataOwner` field is gonna hold the address of the wallet that owns the original copy of the data transaction.

### File Data Transaction Example

The File Data Transaction contains limited information about the file, such as the information required to decrypt it, or the Content-Type (mime-type) needed to view in the browser.

```json
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
 { File Data - Encrypted if private }
```

### File Metadata Transaction Example

The File Metadata Transaction contains the GQL Tags necessary to identify the file within a drive and folder.

Its data contains the JSON metadata for the file. This includes the file name, size, last modified date, data transaction id, and data content type.

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
Drive-Id: "",
Entity-Type: "file",
File-Id: "",
Parent-Folder-Id: "",
Unix-Time: "",
 { File JSON Metadata - Encrypted if private }
```

## Snapshot

ArFS applications generate the latest state of a drive by querying for all ArFS transactions made relating to a user's particular `Drive-Id`. This includes both paged queries for indexed ArFS data via GQL, as well as the ArFS JSON metadata entries for each ArFS transaction.

For small drives (less than 1000 files), a few thousand requests for very small volumes of data can be achieved relatively quickly and reliably. For larger drives, however, this results in long sync times to pull every piece of ArFS metadata when the local database cache is empty. This can also potentially trigger rate-limiting related ArWeave Gateway delays.

Once a drive state has been completely, and accurately generated, in can be rolled up into a single snapshot and uploaded as an Arweave transaction. ArFS clients can use GQL to find and retrieve this snapshot in order to rapidly reconstitute the total state of the drive, or a large portion of it. They can then query individual transactions performed after the snapshot.

This optional method offers convenience and resource efficiency when building the drive state, at the cost of paying for uploading the snapshot data. Using this method means a client will only have to iterate through a few snapshots instead of every transaction performed on the drive.

### Snapshot Entity Tags

Snapshot entities require the following tags. These are queried by ArFS clients to find drive snapshots, organize them together with any other transactions not included within them, and build the latest state of the drive.

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Drive-Id: "",
Entity-Type: "snapshot",
Snapshot-Id: "",
Content-Type: "",
Block-Start: "",
Block-End: "",
Data-Start: ""
```

### Snapshot Entity Data

A JSON data object must also be uploaded with every ArFS Snapshot entity. This data contains all ArFS Drive, Folder, and File metadata changes within the associated drive, as well as any previous Snapshots. The Snapshot Data contains an array `txSnapshots`. Each item includes both the GQL and ArFS metadata details of each transaction made for the associated drive, within the snapshot's start and end period.

A `tsSnapshot` contains a `gqlNode` object which uses the same GQL tags interface returned by the Arweave Gateway. It includes all of the important `block`, `owner`, `tags`, and `bundledIn` information needed by ArFS clients. It also contains a `dataJson` object which stores the correlated Data JSON for that ArFS entity.

For private drives, the `dataJson` object contains the JSON-string-escaped encrypted text of the associated file or folder. This encrypted text uses the file's existing `Cipher` and `Cipher-IV`. This ensures clients can decrypt this information quickly using the existing ArFS privacy protocols.

```json
{
  "txSnapshots": [
    {

# ArFS Protocol (/build/advanced/arfs)

Arweave File System, or "ArFS" is a data modeling, storage, and retrieval protocol designed to emulate common file system operations and to provide aspects of mutability to your data hierarchy on [Arweave](/learn/what-is-arweave)'s otherwise permanent, immutable data storage blockweave.

Due to Arweave's permanent, immutable and public nature traditional file system operations such as permissions, file/folder renaming and moving, and file updates cannot be done by simply updating the on-chain data model.

ArFS works around this by implementing a privacy and encryption pattern and defining an append-only transaction data model using tags within [Arweave Transaction headers](https://docs.arweave.org/developers/server/http-api#transaction-format).

## Key Features

### File Structure

ArFS organizes files and folders using a hierarchical structure. Files are stored as individual transactions on the Arweave blockchain, while folders are metadata that reference these file transactions.

### Metadata

Each file and folder has associated metadata, such as the name, type, size, and modification timestamp. ArFS leverages Arweave's tagging system to store this metadata in a standardized format, which allows for easy querying and organization.

### File Permissions

ArFS supports public and private file permissions. Public files can be accessed by anyone on the network, while private files are encrypted using the owner's private key, ensuring only they can decrypt and access the content.

### File Versioning

ArFS supports versioning of files, allowing users to store multiple versions of a file and access previous versions at any time. This is achieved by linking new file transactions to previous versions through the use of metadata tags.

### Data Deduplication

To minimize storage redundancy and costs, ArFS employs data deduplication techniques. If a user tries to store a file that already exists on the network, the protocol will simply create a new reference to the existing file instead of storing a duplicate copy.

### Search and Discovery

ArFS enables users to search and discover files based on their metadata, such as file names, types, and tags. This is made possible by indexing the metadata stored within the Arweave blockchain.

### Interoperability

ArFS is designed to be interoperable with other decentralized applications and services built on the Arweave network. This allows for seamless integration and collaboration between different applications and users.

## Getting Started

To start using ArFS, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the Arweave ecosystem, acquire AR tokens to cover storage costs, and choose a compatible client or library to interact with the ArFS protocol.

# Privacy & Encryption (/build/advanced/arfs/privacy)

The Arweave blockweave is inherently public. But with apps that use ArFS, like ArDrive, your private data never leaves your computer without using military grade (and [quantum resistant](https://blog.boot.dev/cryptography/is-aes-256-quantum-resistant/#:~:text=Symmetric%20encryption%2C%20or%20more%20specifically,key%20sizes%20are%20large%20enough)) encryption. This privacy layer is applied at the Drive level, and users determine whether a Drive is public or private when they first create it. Private drives must follow the ArFS privacy model.

With ArDrive specifically, every file within a Private Drive is symmetrically encrypted using [AES-256-GCM](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1019/1/012008/pdf) (for small files and metadata transactions) or [AES-256-CTR](https://xilinx.github.io/Vitis_Libraries/security/2020.1/guide_L1/internals/ctr.html) (for large files, over 100MiB). Every Private drive has a master "Drive Key" which uses a combination of the user's Arweave wallet signature, a user defined drive password, and a unique drive identifier ([uuidv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)). Each file has its own "File Key" derived from the "Drive Key". This allows for single files to be shared without exposing access to the other files within the Drive.

Once a file is encrypted and stored on Arweave, it is locked forever and can only be decrypted using its file key.

**NOTE**: Usable encryption standards are not limited to AES-256-GCM or AES-256-CTR. Any Encryption method may be used so long as it is clearly indicated in the `cipher` tag.

## Deriving Keys

Private drives have a global drive key, `D`, and multiple file keys `F`, for encryption. This enables a drive to have as many uniquely encrypted files as needed. One key is used for all versions of a single file (since new file versions use the same File-Id)

`D` is used for encrypting both Drive and Folder metadata, while `F` is used for encrypting File metadata and the actual stored data. Having these different keys, `D` and `F`, allows a user to share specific files without revealing the contents of their entire drive.

`D` is derived using HKDF-SHA256 with an [unsalted]() RSA-PSS signature of the drive's id and a user provided password.

`F` is also derived using HKDF-SHA256 with the drive key and the file's id.

    style D fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#c8e6c9
    style H fill:#c8e6c9
```

Other wallets (like [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io/)) integrate with this Key Derivation protocol just exposing an API to collect a signature from a given Arweave Wallet in order to get the SHA-256 signature needed for the [HKDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HKDF) to derive the Drive Key.

An example implementation, using Dart, is available [here](https://github.com/ardriveapp/ardrive-web/blob/187b3fb30808bda452123c2b18931c898df6a3fb/docs/private_drive_kdf_reference.dart), with a Typescript implementation [here](https://github.com/ardriveapp/ardrive-core-js/blob/f19da30efd30a4370be53c9b07834eae764f8535/src/utils/crypto.ts).

## Private Drives

Drives can store either public or private data. This is indicated by the `Drive-Privacy` tag in the Drive entity metadata.

```
Drive-Privacy: ""
```

If a Drive entity is private, an additional tag `Drive-Auth-Mode` must also be used to indicate how the Drive Key is derived. ArDrive clients currently leverage a secure password along with the Arweave Wallet private key signature to derive the global Drive Key.

```
Drive-Auth-Mode?: 'password'
```

On every encrypted Drive Entity, a `Cipher` tag must be specified, along with the public parameters for decrypting the data. This is done by specifying the parameter with a `Cipher-*` tag. eg. `Cipher-IV`. If the parameter is byte data, it must be encoded as Base64 in the tag.

ArDrive clients currently leverage AES256-GCM for all symmetric encryption, which requires a Cipher Initialization Vector consisting of 12 random bytes.

```
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM"
Cipher-IV?: ""
```

Additionally, all encrypted transactions must have the `Content-Type` tag `application/octet-stream` as opposed to `application/json`

Private Drive Entities and their corresponding Root Folder Entities will both use these keys and ciphers generated to symmetrically encrypt the JSON files that are included in the transaction. This ensures that only the Drive Owner (and whomever the keys have been shared with) can open the drive, discover the root folder, and continue to load the rest of the children in the drive.

## Private Files

When a file is uploaded to a private drive, it by default also becomes private and leverages the same drive keys used for its parent drive. Each unique file in a drive will get its own set of file keys based off of that file's unique `FileId`. If a single file gets a new version, its `File-Id` will be reused, effectively leveraging the same File Key for all versions in that file's history.

These file keys can be shared by the drive's owner as needed.

Private File entities have both its metadata and data transactions encrypted using the same File Key, ensuring all facets of the data is truly private. As such, both the file's metadata and data transactions must both have a unique `Cipher-IV` and `Cipher` tag:

```
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM"
Cipher-IV?: ""
```

Just like drives, private files must have the `Content-Type` tag set as `application/octet-stream` in both its metadata and data transactions:

```
Content-Type: "application/octet-stream"
```

## Encryption Process

Here's how the encryption process works for private drives:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Wallet
    participant Arweave

    User->>Client: Create private drive
    Client->>Wallet: Request signature
    Wallet->>Client: Return signature
    Client->>Client: Derive drive key
    Client->>Client: Encrypt drive metadata
    Client->>Arweave: Upload encrypted drive

    User->>Client: Upload file to private drive
    Client->>Client: Derive file key
    Client->>Client: Encrypt file metadata
    Client->>Client: Encrypt file data
    Client->>Arweave: Upload encrypted metadata
    Client->>Arweave: Upload encrypted data
```

## Security Best Practices

When working with private drives, follow these security guidelines:

### Password Management

- Use strong, unique passwords for each drive
- Consider using a password manager
- Never share passwords in plain text

### Key Storage

- Never store drive keys in plain text
- Use secure key derivation functions
- Implement proper key rotation if needed

### Access Control

- Share file keys only with authorized users
- Implement proper access logging
- Regularly audit drive access

### Data Handling

- Encrypt data before transmission
- Use secure communication channels
- Implement proper error handling

## Drive Signature (ArFS v0.15)

ArFS v0.15 introduces a new `Drive-Signature` entity type to help bridge signature derivation schemes across ArFS versions. This is particularly important for maintaining access to private drives created with older wallet signing methods.

The drive signature entity stores an encrypted version of the pre-v0.15 wallet signature that's necessary for deriving the drive key. This allows continued access to historical drive contents while using modern wallet signing APIs.

## Next Steps

Ready to implement privacy in your ArFS applications?

- [Creating Private Drives](/build/advanced/arfs/creating-drives) - Learn how to create secure drives
- [Upgrading Private Drives](/build/advanced/arfs/upgrading-drives) - Update legacy drives to v0.15
- [Reading Data](/build/advanced/arfs/reading-data) - Query and decrypt your private data

# Reading Data (/build/advanced/arfs/reading-data)

Clients can perform read operations to create a timeline of entity write transactions which can then be replayed to construct the Drive state. This is done by querying an Arweave GraphQL index for the user's respective transactions. [Arweave GraphQL Guide](https://gql-guide.vercel.app/) can provide more information on how to use Arweave GraphQL. If no GraphQL index is available, drive state can only be generated by downloading and inspecting all transactions made by the user's wallet.

This timeline of transactions should be grouped by the block number of each transaction. At every step of the timeline, the client can check if the entity was written by an authorized user. This also conveniently enables the client to surface a trusted entity version history to the user.

To determine the owner of a Drive, clients must check for who created the first Drive Entity transaction using that `Drive-Id`. Until a trusted permissions or ACL system is put in place, any transaction in a drive created by any wallet other than the one who created the first Drive Entity transaction could be considered spam.

The `Unix-Time` defined on each transaction should be reserved for tie-breaking same entity updates in the same block and should not be trusted as the source of truth for entity write ordering. This is unimportant for single owner drives but is crucial for multi-owner drives with updateable permissions (currently undefined in this spec) as a malicious user could fake the `Unix-Time` to modify the drive timeline for other users.

- Drives that have been updated many times can have a long entity timeline which can be a performance bottleneck. To avoid this, clients can cache the drive state locally and sync updates to the file system by only querying for entities in blocks higher than the last time they checked.
- Not checking for Drive Ownership could result in seeing incorrect drive state and GraphQL queries.

## Folder/File Paths

ArweaveFS does not store folder or file paths along with entities as these paths will need to be updated whenever the parent folder name changes which can require many updates for deeply nested file systems. Instead, folder/file paths are left for the client to generate from the folder/file names.

## Folder View Queries

Clients that want to provide users with a quick view of a single folder can simply query for an entity timeline for a particular folder by its id. Clients with multi-owner permissions will additionally have to query for the folder's parent drive entity for permission based filtering of the timeline.

## Basic Query Patterns

### Query All Drive Entities

```graphql
query {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", values: ["0.15"] }
      { name: "Entity-Type", values: ["drive"] }
      { name: "Drive-Id", values: ["your-drive-id"] }
    ]
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        block {
          height
          timestamp
        }
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query Folder Contents

```graphql
query ($parentFolderId: String!) {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", values: ["0.15"] }
      { name: "Parent-Folder-Id", values: [$parentFolderId] }
    ]
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        block {
          height
          timestamp
        }
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Query File Entities

```graphql
query ($fileId: String!) {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", values: ["0.15"] }
      { name: "Entity-Type", values: ["file"] }
      { name: "File-Id", values: [$fileId] }
    ]
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        block {
          height
          timestamp
        }
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Building Drive State

The process of building drive state involves several steps:

```mermaid

    A[Query Drive Entities] --> B[Sort by Block Height]
    B --> C[Process Files First]
    C --> D[Process Folders]

    F --> G[Resolve Conflicts]
    G --> H[Return Complete State]

```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Query for all entities** associated with a specific `Drive-Id`
2. **Sort by block height** to establish chronological order
3. **Process entities bottom-up** starting with files and folders
4. **Build the hierarchy** by following parent-child relationships
5. **Handle conflicts** by using the most recent entity version

### Example Implementation

```javascript
async function buildDriveState(driveId) {
  // Query all entities for the drive
  const entities = await queryDriveEntities(driveId);

  // Sort by block height
  entities.sort((a, b) => a.block.height - b.block.height);

  // Process entities
  const driveState = {
    drive: null,
    folders: new Map(),
    files: new Map(),
  };

  for (const entity of entities) {
    const entityType = getTagValue(entity.tags, "Entity-Type");

    switch (entityType) {
      case "drive":
        driveState.drive = processDriveEntity(entity);
        break;
      case "folder":
        driveState.folders.set(
          getTagValue(entity.tags, "Folder-Id"),
          processFolderEntity(entity)
        );
        break;
      case "file":
        driveState.files.set(
          getTagValue(entity.tags, "File-Id"),
          processFileEntity(entity)
        );
        break;
    }
  }

  return driveState;
}
```

## Using Snapshots

For large drives, snapshots can significantly improve performance:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway
    participant Arweave

    Client->>Gateway: Query for latest snapshot
    Gateway->>Client: Return snapshot data
    Client->>Client: Process snapshot data
    Client->>Gateway: Query for newer transactions
    Gateway->>Client: Return newer entities
    Client->>Client: Merge with snapshot data
    Client->>Client: Return complete drive state
```

### Snapshot Query

```graphql
query ($driveId: String!) {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", values: ["0.15"] }
      { name: "Entity-Type", values: ["snapshot"] }
      { name: "Drive-Id", values: [$driveId] }
    ]
    sort: HEIGHT_DESC
    first: 1
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        block {
          height
          timestamp
        }
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies

- **Local caching** - Store frequently accessed data locally
- **Incremental updates** - Only fetch new transactions since last sync
- **Snapshot usage** - Use snapshots for large drives
- **Batch queries** - Combine multiple queries when possible

### Query Optimization

- **Use specific tags** - Narrow down queries with relevant tags
- **Limit results** - Use pagination for large result sets
- **Filter by date** - Query specific time ranges

# Upgrading Private Drives (/build/advanced/arfs/upgrading-drives)

## Overview

Private drives rely on a combination of user-set password and a wallet signature for encryption and decryption. [Wander](https://www.wander.app/), formerly ArConnect, is a popular Arweave wallet that is deprecating its `signature()` method in favor of `signDataItem()` or `signMessage()`. In order to preserve access to private drive contents that were secured via drive keys created via 'signature()', ArFS v0.15 introduces a new drive key derivation scheme that both utilizes the modern signing APIs and bridges historical drive keys for usage with it.

Because private drive entities exist on chain and their encryption cannot be altered, an upgrade is required to allow continued access to "V1" private drives. This upgrade essentially takes a signature from the drive owner wallet, encrypts it using the required signature structure for V2 private drives, and places it on Arweave as a new "Drive-Signature" entity. This allows the signature to be fetched and decrypted using the latest methods before using it to decrypt the private drive in the V1 format.

The below instructions for upgrading a private drive will work during the deprecation period for the `signature()` method from Wanter. Once this period is over, and `signature()` loses all support, additional steps will be required to obtain the correct signature format to decrypt V1 private drives in order to upgrade them.

There is, at this time, no set date for when the deprecation period will end.

## The Upgrade Process

The upgrade process involves creating a new `Drive-Signature` entity that contains an encrypted version of the legacy signature needed to decrypt the private drive.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Client
    participant Wallet
    participant Arweave

    User->>Client: Initiate drive upgrade
    Client->>Wallet: Request legacy signature
    Wallet->>Client: Return signature
    Client->>Client: Encrypt signature with v0.15 scheme
    Client->>Arweave: Upload Drive-Signature entity
    Client->>Client: Update drive with Signature-Type tag
    Client->>Arweave: Upload updated drive entity
    Client->>User: Upgrade complete
```

### Drive-Signature Entity

The `Drive-Signature` entity stores the encrypted legacy signature:

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Entity-Type: "drive-signature",
Signature-Format: "1",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV: ""
{data: }
```

### Updated Drive Entity

The drive entity is updated with a new `Signature-Type` tag:

```json
ArFS: "0.15",
Cipher?: "AES256-GCM",
Cipher-IV?: "",
Content-Type: "",
Drive-Id: "",
Drive-Privacy: "",
Drive-Auth-Mode?: "password",
Entity-Type: "drive",
Signature-Type?: "1",
Unix-Time: ""

Metadata JSON {
    "name": "",
    "rootFolderId": "",
    "isHidden": false
}
```

## Using ArDrive

The upgrade process has been made simple by using the [ArDrive app](https://app.ardrive.io/).

### Step 1: Log into ArDrive

If the connected wallet has V1 private drives that need to be updated, a banner will appear at the top of the screen.

![ArDrive Upgrade Banner](https://arweave.net/kJzzrYY4KIHLTC9VOECfzvVAjaO1_FOkejWgsRNbLx4)

### Step 2: Click "Update Now!"

This will open a modal listing the drives that need to be updated, and linking to more information about the upgrade process.

![ArDrive Upgrade Modal](https://arweave.net/Qa-qeKkr1flXl1-fdLapjKNmme0lKA43YQbjmMvnF-U)

### Step 3: Click "Update"

The process of upgrading the private drives will begin, and involve signing messages depending on how many drives are being upgraded. When the process is complete, a new modal will appear listing the drives that have been successfully updated.

## Manual Upgrade Process

If you need to upgrade drives programmatically, here's the process:

### 1. Identify V1 Drives

Query for drives that don't have the `Signature-Type` tag:

```graphql
query {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", values: ["0.15"] }
      { name: "Entity-Type", values: ["drive"] }
      { name: "Drive-Privacy", values: ["private"] }
    ]
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Create Drive-Signature Entity

```javascript
async function createDriveSignature(driveId, legacySignature) {
  // Encrypt the legacy signature
  const encryptedSignature = await encryptSignature(legacySignature);

  // Create the drive signature entity
  const driveSignature = {
    data: encryptedSignature,
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", value: "0.15" },
      { name: "Entity-Type", value: "drive-signature" },
      { name: "Signature-Format", value: "1" },
      { name: "Cipher", value: "AES256-GCM" },
      { name: "Cipher-IV", value: cipherIV },
    ],
  };

  // Upload to Arweave
  return await uploadTransaction(driveSignature);
}
```

### 3. Update Drive Entity

```javascript
async function updateDriveEntity(driveId) {
  // Get existing drive entity
  const driveEntity = await getDriveEntity(driveId);

  // Add Signature-Type tag
  const updatedTags = [
    ...driveEntity.tags,
    { name: "Signature-Type", value: "1" },
  ];

  // Create updated drive entity
  const updatedDrive = {
    data: driveEntity.data,
    tags: updatedTags,
  };

  // Upload to Arweave
  return await uploadTransaction(updatedDrive);
}
```

## Verification

After upgrading, verify the process was successful:

### Check Drive-Signature Entity

```graphql
query ($driveId: String!) {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", values: ["0.15"] }
      { name: "Entity-Type", values: ["drive-signature"] }
      { name: "Drive-Id", values: [$driveId] }
    ]
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        block {
          height
          timestamp
        }
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Check Updated Drive Entity

```graphql
query ($driveId: String!) {
  transactions(
    tags: [
      { name: "ArFS", values: ["0.15"] }
      { name: "Entity-Type", values: ["drive"] }
      { name: "Drive-Id", values: [$driveId] }
      { name: "Signature-Type", values: ["1"] }
    ]
  ) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        block {
          height
          timestamp
        }
        tags {
          name
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Signature not found** - Ensure the wallet supports the required signing methods
- **Encryption errors** - Verify the encryption parameters are correct
- **Upload failures** - Check network connectivity and retry
- **Permission denied** - Ensure you own the drive being upgraded

### Error Handling

```javascript
async function upgradeDrive(driveId) {
  try {
    // Get legacy signature
    const legacySignature = await getLegacySignature(driveId);

    // Create drive signature entity
    await createDriveSignature(driveId, legacySignature);

    // Update drive entity
    await updateDriveEntity(driveId);

    console.log("Drive upgraded successfully");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Upgrade failed:", error);
    // Handle error appropriately
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Before Upgrading

- **Backup your data** - Ensure you have access to your drive contents
- **Test with one drive** - Start with a single drive to verify the process
- **Check wallet compatibility** - Ensure your wallet supports required methods
- **Verify ownership** - Confirm you own the drives being upgraded

### During Upgrading

- **Monitor progress** - Keep track of upgrade status
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Implement proper error handling
- **Batch operations** - Upgrade multiple drives efficiently
- **User feedback** - Provide clear status updates

### After Upgrading

- **Verify functionality** - Test drive access and operations
- **Update clients** - Ensure all clients support v0.15
- **Monitor performance** - Check for any performance issues
- **Document changes** - Keep track of upgraded drives

# EthAReum Protocol (/build/advanced/ethareum)

The **EthAReum protocol** enables the generation of private keys for an Arweave wallet using a signature from an Ethereum or Solana wallet. This allows users to create an Arweave wallet directly through popular wallet providers like MetaMask, providing seamless cross-chain wallet management.

Generated private keys provide a fully functional Arweave wallet, equipped to perform all standard operations, including holding AR tokens and Turbo Credits, and uploading data to the Arweave network.

## How It Works

EthAReum uses a deterministic key derivation process that combines:

- **Ethereum/Solana wallet signature** - Provides the cryptographic foundation
- **User-generated password** - Adds additional entropy and security
- **Standardized derivation algorithm** - Ensures reproducible results

The protocol generates a unique Arweave wallet that is cryptographically linked to your Ethereum or Solana wallet but remains completely independent.

## Browser Compatibility

  **Recommended Browser**: For optimal performance, use **Chrome** when working
  with EthAReum and MetaMask. While EthAReum functions correctly in most
  browsers, there are ongoing efforts to resolve some edge case compatibility
  issues in other environments.

## Password Security

The EthAReum protocol incorporates a user-generated password in the wallet derivation process. This password provides an extra layer of security by contributing additional entropy to the wallet's derivation and serves as a critical verification step for wallet access.

  **Permanent Password**: The password used during the derivation of private
  keys is **permanent and cannot be changed or recovered** by any administrator.
  ArDrive is a decentralized platform with no account administration. It is
  crucial to keep this password secure.

### Password Requirements

- Must be set during initial wallet creation
- Used for all subsequent logins
- Required for encrypting private uploads
- Cannot be recovered if forgotten

## Wallet Addresses

The public address of the generated Arweave wallet is derived from its public key and will be **different** from the public address of the Ethereum or Solana wallet used to generate it.

### Viewing Your Address

The exact steps to obtain your generated wallet's public address depend on the dApp interface:

- **ArDrive**: Click the user profile icon in the top right when logged in
- **Other dApps**: Check the wallet settings or profile section

## Key Management

### Keyfiles vs Seed Phrases

The Arweave ecosystem primarily uses **keyfiles** rather than seed phrases for wallet access:

- **Keyfile**: JSON file containing a Json Web Key (JWK) that acts as private keys
- **Seed Phrase**: Supported but not universally implemented across all dApps

  **Keyfile Security**: Always treat your keyfile with the same care as you
  would private keys for an Ethereum wallet. Learn more about keyfiles in the
  [Arweave Cookbook](https://cookbook.arweave.dev/).

### Accessing Your Keys

Both keyfile and seed phrase are available for download in most dApps:

- **ArDrive**: Click the user profile icon in the top right when logged in
- **Other dApps**: Check wallet settings or 
## Security Considerations

### One-Way Control

EthAReum generates Arweave wallet private keys using a signature from your Ethereum/Solana wallet, ensuring that control only extends in one direction:

- ✅ **EthAReum can generate** Arweave wallets from Ethereum/Solana signatures
- ❌ **EthAReum cannot access** your Ethereum/Solana wallet or assets
- ✅ **Your Ethereum/Solana assets remain** completely secure and independent

### Signature Security

  **Beware of Malicious dApps**: Some malicious dApps or websites may disguise
  high-risk authorization transactions as simple signature requests. Always
  ensure that you only provide signatures to reputable and trusted dApps like
  ArDrive.

### Best Practices

1. **Verify dApp authenticity** before providing signatures
2. **Use strong, unique passwords** for wallet derivation
3. **Backup your keyfile** in a secure location
4. **Never share your password** or keyfile with anyone
5. **Test with small amounts** before committing to large transactions

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Wallet Generation

```javascript
// Example: Generate Arweave wallet from Ethereum signature
async function generateArweaveWallet(ethereumSignature, password) {
  // This is a conceptual example - actual implementation
  // would use the EthAReum protocol specification

  const derivedKey = await deriveKeyFromSignature(
    ethereumSignature,
    password,
    "arweave" // derivation context
  );

  return {
    address: getAddressFromKey(derivedKey),
    keyfile: createKeyfile(derivedKey),
    seedPhrase: generateSeedPhrase(derivedKey),
  };
}
```

### Integration with MetaMask

```javascript
// Example: Request signature from MetaMask
async function requestEthereumSignature() {
  const accounts = await ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_requestAccounts",
  });

  const message = "Sign this message to generate your Arweave wallet";
  const signature = await ethereum.request({
    method: "personal_sign",
    params: [message, accounts[0]],
  });

  return signature;
}
```

# Normalized Addresses (/build/advanced/normalized-addresses)

## Overview

Different blockchains use different formats for the [public keys](/glossary) of wallets, and the [native addresses](/glossary) for those wallets. In most cases, when a system in the Arweave ecosystem needs to display the wallet address of a wallet from a different blockchain, for instance in the `Owner.address` value of an AO process spawned by an ETH wallet, that address will be normalized into the format recognized by Arweave. Specifically, a 43 character base64url representation of the sha256 hash of the public key. This is done to prevent potential errors by systems in the Arweave ecosystem that expect these values to be a certain size and conform to a specific format.

Essentially, normalized addresses are a way to represent public keys and wallet addresses from other blockchains in a way that is familiar to systems in the Arweave ecosystem.

A tool for easily obtaining a normalized addresses from public keys can be found at [ar://normalize-my-key](https://normalize-my-key.arweave.net/)

## Public Keys and Addresses

Crypto wallets consist of two separate components. The public keys, which are public knowledge and can be seen by anyone, and the private keys, which only the owner of a wallet should have access to. Crypto wallet addresses are derived from the public key.

  {" "}
  It is important to note that all crypto wallet public and private keys are
  binary data. The values provided below for Arweave and Ethereum/Polygon public
  keys are base64url and hex encoded representations of that binary data
  respectively.

### Arweave

The public key for an Arweave wallet is the `n` field of the JWK json file.

  0jkGWDFYI3DHEWaXhZitjTg67T-enQwXs50lTDrMhy2qb619_91drv_50J5PwrOYJiMmYhiEA5ojMvrrAFY-Dm1bJbJfVBU1kIsPho2tFcXnbSOa2_1bovAys0ckJU07wkbmIUpzp3trdxYReB4jayMMOXWw9B8xS0v81zFmK3IbCtL9N6WNTMONOSMATHFQrGqtDhDUqKyIsQZCBPFvfGykRWaLWzbtAUrApprqG9hfExQzppNsw0gsftNSHZ1emC5tC2fuib6FhQw9TE2ge9tUjEZNALcVZvopTtTX0H2gEfnRJ48UNeV3SKggjXcoPVeivmqXuPBGncXWWq1pHR-Xs4zSLA5Mgcw_tQJc4FIER0i7hUlZXoc991ZHyOvAC-GlHWzQwvrlY11oD38pB47NkHN2WVPtUCAtyYQe5TE6Xznd9kPgqqvVUkV0s0suh5vINGoiPEnMjyhYEN7eOmJRIJ_A87IJesbdPRV4ZzBsqPbd02RG3ZuVpc3gI1xKvwH1WS05XI8eWK-BbvB3oxB7WjaQTWcfBWhMEULiwx-SucuyAzPAw3i6Wjtq61TcL9SdWhmOf9_yo-Np052tj7MQ66nmgdOH_MEKYjAdFypxTsRQoSLbv28HEcSjwx8u3pY0q0gKMK_5X2XKJrp2i2GB_fVgbcpH9YsgrYxh1Q8

The public wallet address for that wallet is `9ODOd-_ZT9oWoRMVmmD4G5f9Z6MjvYxO3Nen-T5OXvU`, this is obtained by decoding the public key from base64url to normalize padding, sha256 hashing the result, and then base64url encoding that.

### Ethereum/Polygon

The public key for an EVM wallet (Ethereum, Polygon/Matic) is derived from its private key, using the [Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm), or ECDSA.

`0xb5d96e5533334a630af9d50b226011d44b9879c3165ffee0601bb0bac621e0047c302d4b72e4b1ca145043940c53093021825726cacdbf1d0a0e8ff2e70a4037`

The public wallet address is `0x084af408C8E492aC52dc0Ec76514A7deF8D5F03f`, this is obtained by removing the first byte from the public key, Keccak-256 hashing the remainder, taking the the last 20 bytes (40 hexadecimal characters) and prepending `0x` to it.

### Solana

A Solana wallet is an array of 64 bytes. The first 32 bytes are the private key, and the last 32 bytes are the public key. Below is the public key portion of a Solana wallet:

`[172, 175, 23, 95, 23, 124, 38, 171, 25, 20, 245, 213, 59, 9, 18, 89, 46, 70, 135, 84, 137, 205, 251, 95, 8, 226, 233, 46, 78, 34, 212, 86]`

The public wallet address for this wallet is `Cd5yb4mvbuQyyJgAkriFZbWQivh2zM68KGZX8Ksn1L85`, this is derived by base58 encoding the public key bytes.

## Normalizing Addresses

As shown in the above examples, the format of public keys, and the resulting derived wallet addresses, vary widely between blockchains. Arweave manages this by applying the same derivation methods that Arweave uses for its own wallets to the public keys from other chains.

### Ethereum/Polygon

The leading `0x` and uncompressed flag `04` (if present) is removed from the public key of an EVM wallet, and then the remainder is base64url encoded to obtain the Arweave normalized public key. Continuing with the same public key in the above example, the normalized public key would be:

`2W5VMzNKYwr51QsiYBHUS5h5wxZf_uBgG7C6xiHgBHwwLUty5LHKFFBDlAxTCTAhglcmys2_HQoOj_LnCkA3`

This value is what is used as the GraphQL tag `owner` value for data items being uploaded to Arweave using an EVM wallet. The normalized address is then derived from this value by sha256 hashing it, and then base64url encoding the result:

`5JtuS4yOFtUX2Rg3UU7AgBaUqh4s8wyyNTZk9UrzI-Q`

### Solana

The normalized public key for Solana wallets are derived similarly. The 32 byte public key is base64url encoded:

`rK8XXxd8JqsZFPXVOwkSWS5Gh1SJzftfCOLpLk4i1FY`

Again, this value is used for the GraphQl tag `owner` when uploading data. It can then be sha256 hashed, and base64url encoded again to derive the normalized address:

`K8kpPM1RID8ZM2sjF5mYy0rP4gXSRDbrwPUd9Qths64`

# Browser Sandboxing (/build/advanced/sandboxing)

## Overview

Browser sandboxing allows data requests to a gateway node to benefit from the security advantages of using a browser's same-origin policy by redirecting the requests to a pseudo-unique subdomain of the gateway's apex domain. For example, an attempt to access `https://arweave.net/gnWKBqFXMJrrksEWrXLQRUQQQeFhv4uVxesHBcT8i6o` would redirect to `https://qj2yubvbk4yjv24syelk24wqivcbaqpbmg7yxfof5mdqlrh4rova.arweave.net/gnWKBqFXMJrrksEWrXLQRUQQQeFhv4uVxesHBcT8i6o`

Two DNS records are required to link a domain to an Arweave transaction on a gateway node. For example, `www.mycustomsite.com` would need the following records to link it to `www.arweave-gateway.net`:

- A DNS CNAME record pointing to an Arweave gateway: www CNAME `arweave-gateway.net`,
- A DNS TXT record linking the domain with a specific transaction ID: arweavetx TXT `kTv4OkVtmc0NAsqIcnHfudKjykJeQ83qXXrxf8hrh0S`

When a browser requests `www.mycustomsite.com` the user's machine will (through the usual DNS processes) resolve this to the IP address for the gateway node `arweave-gateway.net`. When the gateway receives an HTTP request with a non-default hostname, e.g. `www.mycustomsite.com` instead of `www.arweave-gateway.net`, the gateway will query the DNS records for `www.mycustomsite.com` and the 'arweavetx' TXT record will tell the node which transaction to serve.

## TLS and its Role in Browser Sandboxing

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network. In the context of Arweave applications and browser sandboxing, TLS plays a critical role in ensuring secure data transmission and enabling the effective use of browser security features.

When Arweave applications are accessed without TLS, most browsers restrict the use of native cryptographic functions. These functions, which include hashing, signing, and verification, are essential for the secure operation of Arweave permaweb apps. Without TLS, not only are these functions unavailable, but the applications also become susceptible to various security threats, notably man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Although Arweave transactions are signed, making direct MITM attacks challenging, the absence of encryption can expose other vulnerabilities. For instance, attackers could intercept and alter the `/price` endpoint, potentially causing transaction failures or leading to overcharging.

To address these concerns, gateway operators are responsible for generating and maintaining TLS certificates for their gateways. This can be achieved through various systems, such as ACME for Let's Encrypt. An important step in setting up a gateway is obtaining a wildcard TLS certificate for the gateway's domain. This certificate secures traffic on both the apex domain and its single-level subdomains (e.g., `gateway.com` and `subdomain.gateway.com`).

The integration of TLS is crucial for the implementation of browser sandboxing. When a browser requests a transaction from a gateway, the gateway issues a 301 redirect to a subdomain of the gateway, using a Base32 pseudo-unique address derived from the transaction ID. This redirection, secured by TLS, invokes the browser's same-origin policy. As a result, the requested web page is confined within a secure sandbox environment, isolated from other domains. This isolation is vital for maintaining the integrity and security of transactions and interactions within Arweave's permaweb applications.

## Deriving Sandbox Value

AR.IO nodes generate browser sandbox values deterministically. Because of this, it is possible to calculate ahead of time what that value will be for a particular transaction id.

Sandbox values are a Base32 encoding of the transaction ID. AR.IO gateways use the following code snippet to accomplish the encoding:

```typescript
const expectedTxSandbox = (id: string): string => {
  return toB32(fromB64Url(id))
}
```

Example:

```typescript
const id = 'gnWKBqFXMJrrksEWrXLQRUQQQeFhv4uVxesHBcT8i6o'
const expectedTxSandbox = (id): string => {
  return toB32(fromB64Url(id))
}
console.log(expectedTxSandbox)
```

Example Output:

```console
qj2yubvbk4yjv24syelk24wqivcbaqpbmg7yxfof5mdqlrh4rova
```

# Bundler (/build/extensions/bundler)

## Overview

A [Turbo ANS-104](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-upload-service/) data item bundler can be run alongside an AR.IO gateway. This allows gateways the ability to accept data items to be submitted to the Arweave blockweave.

The bundler service can be easily run inside Docker in the same way that the gateway is. It utilizes a separate docker compose file for configuration and deployment, which also allows for the use of a separate file for environmental variables specific to the bundler service. Additionally, the separation allows operators to spin their bundler service up or down at any time without affecting their core gateway service. Despite the use of separate docker compose files, the bundler service shares a docker network with the AR.IO gateway, and so is able to directly interact with the gateway service and data.

For more information on ANS-104 Bundles, see the [ANS-104 Bundles](/learn/ans-104-bundles) page.

## Getting Started

  **NOTE**: The bundler service relies on GraphQL indexing of recently bundled
  and uploaded data to manage its pipeline operations. The AR.IO gateway should
  have its indexes synced up to Arweave's current block height before starting
  the bundler's service stack.

### Configure Environmental Variables

Environmental variables must be provided for the bundler to function and integrate properly with an existing AR.IO gateway. The gateway repository provides a `.env.bundler.example` file that can be renamed to `.env.bundler` and used as a starting point. It contains the following:

```bash
BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_WALLET='Stringified JWK wallet. e.g: '{ "n": "...", ... }'
BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS='Address for above wallet'

APP_NAME='AR.IO bundler service'

# Use localstack s3 bucket for shared data source between AR.IO gateway and bundler
AWS_S3_BUCKET=ar.io
AWS_S3_PREFIX='data'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='test'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='test'
AWS_REGION='us-east-1'
AWS_ENDPOINT='http://localstack:4566'
```

- `BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_WALLET` must be the entire jwk of an Arweave wallet's keyfile, stringified. All uploads of bundled data items to Arweave will be signed and paid for by this wallet, so it must maintain a balance of AR tokens sufficient to handle the uploads.
- `BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS` must be the [normalized public address](/glossary) for the provided Arweave wallet.
- `APP_NAME` is a GraphQL tag that will be added to uploaded bundles.

The remaining lines in the `.env.bundler.example` file control settings that allow the bundler service to share data with the AR.IO gateway. Data sharing of contiguous data between a bundler and a gateway allows the gateway to serve optimistically cached data without waiting for it to fully settle on chain.

### Configure Optimistic Indexing

By default, the bundler will only accept data items uploaded by data item signers whose [normalized wallet addresses](/glossary) are in the `ALLOW_LISTED_ADDRESSES` list. This is an additional environmental variable that can be added to your `.env.bundler` file, and must be a comma separated list of normalized public wallet addresses for wallets that should be allowed to bundle and upload data through your gateway.

```bash
ALLOW_LISTED_ADDRESSES=,
```

The following permissioning configurations schemes are also possible:

| Scheme                     | ALLOW_LISTED_ADDRESSES                      | SKIP_BALANCE_CHECKS | ALLOW_LISTED_SIGNATURE_TYPES | PAYMENT_SERVICE_BASE_URL |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Allow Specific Wallets** | Comma-separated normalized wallet addresses | false               | EMPTY or supplied            | EMPTY                    |
| **Allow Specific chains**  | EMPTY or supplied                           | false               | arbundles sigtype int        | EMPTY                    |
| **Allow All**              | n/a                                         | true                | n/a                          | n/a                      |
| **Allow None**             | EMPTY                                       | false               | EMPTY                        | EMPTY                    |
| **Allow Payers**           | EMPTY or supplied                           | false               | EMPTY or supplied            | Your payment service url |

### Set Up Indexing

Bundlers submit data to the Arweave network as an [ANS-104 data item bundle](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-104.md). This means it is several transactions wrapped into one. A gateway will need to unbundle these transactions in order to index them. A gateway should include the following ANS-104 filters in order to unbundle and index transactions from a particular bundler:

```bash
ANS104_INDEX_FILTER={ "always": true }
ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER={ "attributes": { "owner_address": "$BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS" } }
```

`$BUNDLER_ARWEAVE_ADDRESS` should be replaced with the [normalized public wallet address](/glossary) associated with the bundler.

**NOTE**: The above filters must be placed in the `.env` file for the core gateway service, not the bundler.

Gateways handle data item indexing asynchronously. This means they establish a queue of items to index, and work on processing the queue in the background while the gateway continues with its normal operations. If a gateway has broad indexing filters, there can be some latency in indexing data items from the bundler while the gateway works through its queue.

### Configure Optimistic Indexing

Gateway operators control access to their [optimistic data item indexing](/glossary) API via an admin key that must be supplied by all bundling clients in order for their requests to be accepted. This key should be made available in the environment configuration files for BOTH the core gateway, and the bundler, and should be provided as `AR_IO_ADMIN_KEY`:

```bash
AR_IO_ADMIN_KEY="Admin password"
```

**NOTE**: If a gateway is started without providing the admin key, a random string will be generated to protect the gateway's admin endpoints. This can be reset by restarting the gateway with the admin key provided in the `.env` file.

## Starting and Stopping the Bundler

### Starting

The bundler service is designed to run in conjunction with an AR.IO gateway, and so relies on the `ar-io-network` network created in Docker when the core gateway services are spun up. It is possible to spin up the bundler while the core services are down, but the network must exist in Docker.

To start the bundler, specify the env and docker-compose files being used in a `docker compose up` command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file ./.env.bundler --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml up -d
```

The `-d` flag runs the command in "detached" mode, so it will run in the background without requiring the terminal to remain active.

### Stopping

To spin the bundler service down, specify the docker-compose file in a `docker compose down` command:

```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml down
```

### Logs

While the bundler service is running in detached mode, logs can be checked by specifying the docker-compose file in a `docker compose logs` command:

```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml logs -f --tail=0
```

- `-f` runs the command in "follow" mode, so the terminal will continue to watch and display new logs.
- `--tail=` defines the number of logs to display that existed prior to running the command. `0` displays only new logs.

## Useful Docker Commands

Monitor and manage your bundler service with these commands:

```bash
# View all running services
docker ps

# Start bundler service in background
docker compose --env-file ./.env.bundler --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml up -d

# Stop bundler service
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml down

# Pull latest bundler images
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml pull

# Follow bundler logs
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml logs -f --tail=10

# Check bundler service status
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml ps

# Restart bundler service
docker compose --file docker-compose.bundler.yaml restart
```

# ClickHouse & Parquet (/build/extensions/clickhouse)

## Overview

AR.IO gateway Release 33 introduces a new configuration option for using Parquet files and ClickHouse to improve performance and scalability of your AR.IO gateway for large datasets.

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up ClickHouse with your AR.IO gateway, and importing Parquet files to bootstrap your ClickHouse database.

## What is Parquet?

Apache Parquet is a columnar storage file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Unlike row-based storage formats like SQLite, Parquet organizes data by column rather than by row, which provides several advantages for analytical workloads:

- **Efficient compression**: Similar data is stored together, leading to better compression ratios
- **Columnar access**: You can read only the columns you need, reducing I/O operations
- **Predicate pushdown**: Filter operations can be pushed down to the storage layer, improving query performance

For more information about Parquet, see the [Parquet documentation](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/).

## Current Integration with AR.IO Gateways

In the current AR.IO gateway implementation, Parquet and ClickHouse run alongside SQLite rather than replacing it. This parallel architecture allows each database to handle what it does best:

- **SQLite** continues to handle transaction writes and updates
- **ClickHouse** with Parquet files is optimized for fast query performance, especially with large datasets

The gateway continues to operate with SQLite just as it always has, maintaining all of its normal functionality. Periodically, the gateway will 
Note that despite Parquet's efficient compression, gateways may not see significant disk space reduction in all cases. While bundled transaction data is exported to Parquet, L1 data remains in SQLite. Without substantial unbundling and indexing filters, minimal data gets exported to Parquet, limiting potential storage savings.

With ClickHouse integration enabled, GraphQL queries are primarily routed to ClickHouse, leveraging its superior performance for large datasets. This significantly improves response times while maintaining SQLite's reliability for transaction processing.

For more information about gateway architecture and data processing, see our [Gateway Architecture](/learn/gateways/architecture) documentation.

## Parquet vs. SQLite in AR.IO Gateways

While SQLite is excellent for transactional workloads and small to medium datasets, it faces challenges with very large datasets:

| Feature                  | SQLite                        | Parquet + ClickHouse             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Storage model            | Row-based                     | Column-based                     |
| Query optimization       | Basic                         | Advanced analytical optimization |
| Compression              | Limited                       | High compression ratios          |
| Scaling                  | Limited by single file        | Distributed processing capable   |
| Write speed              | Fast for small transactions   | Optimized for batch operations   |
| Read speed for analytics | Slower for large datasets     | Optimized for analytical queries |
| Ideal use case           | Recent transaction data, OLTP | Historical data, OLAP workloads  |

## Benefits for Gateway Operators

Implementing Parquet and ClickHouse alongside SQLite in your AR.IO gateway offers several key advantages:

- **Dramatically improved query performance** for GraphQL endpoints, especially for large result sets
- **Reduced storage requirements** through efficient columnar compression
- **Better scalability** for growing datasets
- **Faster bootstrapping** of new gateways through Parquet file imports
- **Reduced load on SQLite** by offloading query operations to ClickHouse

The primary focus of the Parquet/ClickHouse integration is the significant speed improvement for querying large datasets. Gateway operators managing significant volumes of data will notice substantial performance gains when using this configuration.

## Storage Considerations

While Parquet files offer more efficient compression for the data they contain, it's important to understand the storage impact:

- Bundled transaction data is exported to Parquet and removed from SQLite, potentially saving space
- L1 data remains in SQLite regardless of Parquet configuration
- Space savings are highly dependent on your unbundling filters - without substantial unbundling configurations, minimal data gets exported to Parquet
- The more data you unbundle and 
For gateway operators, this means proper filter configuration is crucial to realize storage benefits. The primary advantage remains significantly improved query performance for large datasets, with potential space savings as a secondary benefit depending on your specific configuration.

The following sections will guide you through setting up ClickHouse with your AR.IO gateway, exporting data from SQLite to Parquet, and importing Parquet files to bootstrap your ClickHouse database.

The below instructions are designed to be used in a linux environment. Windows and MacOS users must modify the instructions to use the appropriate package manager/ command syntax for their platform.

Unless otherwise specified, all commands should be run from the root directory of the gateway.

## Installing ClickHouse

ClickHouse is a powerful, open-source analytical database that excels at handling large datasets and complex queries. It is the tool used by the gateway to integrate with the Parquet format.

For more information about ClickHouse, see the [ClickHouse documentation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/).

### Add ClickHouse Repository

It is recommended to use [official pre-compiled deb packages for Debian or Ubuntu](https://clickhouse.com/docs/install#quick-install). Run these commands to install packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
curl -fsSL 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/rpm/lts/repodata/repomd.xml.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg

ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg arch=${ARCH}] https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
sudo apt-get update
```

This will verify the installation package from official sources and enable installation via `apt-get`.

### Install ClickHouse

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y clickhouse-client
```

This will perform the actual installation of the ClickHouse server and client.

During installation, you will be prompted to set a password for the `default` user. This is required to connect to the ClickHouse server.

Advanced users may also choose to create a designated user account in clickhouse for the gateway to use, but the default gateway configuration will assume the `default` user.

## Configure Gateway to use ClickHouse

### Set Basic ClickHouse Configuration

Because the gateway will be accessing ClickHouse, host address andthe password for the selected user must be provided. This is done via the `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` environment variable.

Update your .env file with the following:

```bash
CLICKHOUSE_URL="http://clickhouse:8123"
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=
```

If you set a specific user account for the gateway to use, you can set the `CLICKHOUSE_USER` environment variable to the username.

```bash
CLICKHOUSE_USER=
```

If omitted, the gateway will use the `default` user.

### Configure Unbundling Filters

Additionally, The Parquet file provided below contains an unbundled data set that includes all data items uploaded via an ArDrive product, including Turbo. Because of this, it is recommended to include unbundling filters that match, or expand, this configuration.

```bash
ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER='{ "and": [ { "not": { "or": [ { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "Warp" } ] }, { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "Redstone" } ] }, { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "KYVE" } ] }, { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "AO" } ] }, { "attributes": { "owner_address": "-OXcT1sVRSA5eGwt2k6Yuz8-3e3g9WJi5uSE99CWqsBs" } }, { "attributes": { "owner_address": "ZE0N-8P9gXkhtK-07PQu9d8me5tGDxa_i4Mee5RzVYg" } }, { "attributes": { "owner_address": "6DTqSgzXVErOuLhaP0fmAjqF4yzXkvth58asTxP3pNw" } } ] } }, { "tags": [ { "name": "App-Name", "valueStartsWith": "ArDrive" } ] } ] }'
ANS104_INDEX_FILTER='{ "tags": [ { "name": "App-Name", "value": "ArDrive-App" } ] }'
```

### Set Admin API Key

Lastly, you must have a gateway admin password set. This is used for the periodic 
```bash
ADMIN_API_KEY=
```

Once the .env file is updated, restart the gateway to apply the changes.

## Downloading and Importing the Parquet File

### Download the Parquet File

A Parquet archive file is available for download from [ar://JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM](https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM). This file contains an unbundled data set that includes all data items uploaded via an ArDrive product, current to April 23, 2025, and compressed using tar.gz.

To download the file, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM -o 2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet.tar.gz
```

or visit the url [https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM](https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM) and download the file manually.

If downloaded manually, it will download as a binary file named `JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM`. This is normal and must be converted to a tar.gz file by renaming it to `2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet.tar.gz`.

It should also be placed in the root directory of the gateway.

The downloaded file will be approximately 3.5GB in size.

### Extract the Parquet Files

With the parquet file downloaded and placed in the root directory of the gateway, you can extract the file and import it into ClickHouse.

```bash
tar -xzf 2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet.tar.gz
```

This will extract the file into a directory named `2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet`, and take a while to complete.

### Prepare the Data Directory

Next, if you do not already have a `data/parquet` directory, you must create it. Release 33 does not have this directory by default, but future Releases will. You can create the directory by using the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p data/parquet
```

or by starting the gateway ClickHouse container with the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up clickhouse -d
```

Depending on your system configurations, allowing the gateway to create the directory may result in the directory being created with incorrect permissions. If this is the case, you can remove the restrictions by running the following command:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 data/parquet
```

With the directory created, you can now move the extracted parquet files into it.

```bash
mv 2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet/* data/parquet
```

### Import Data into ClickHouse

When this is complete, you can run the import script to import the parquet files into ClickHouse.

If you haven't done so already, start the ClickHouse container with the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up clickhouse -d
```

Then run the import script with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/clickhouse-import
```

This process will take several minutes, and will output the progress of the import.

## Verifying Successful Import

### Verify ClickHouse Import

To verify that the import was successful, run the following commands:

```bash
clickhouse client --password  -h localhost -q 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM transactions'
```

Being sure to replace `` with the password you set for the selected ClickHouse user.

This should return a count of the number of unique transactions in the parquet file, which is `32712311`.

### Test GraphQL Endpoint

You can also verify that the data is being served by the gateway's GraphQL endpoint by ensuring the gateway is not proxying its GraphQL queries (Make sure `GRAPHQL_HOST` is not set) and running the following command:

```bash
curl -g -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"query { transactions(ids: [\"YSNwoYB01EFIzbs6HmkGUjjxHW3xuqh-rckYhi0av4A\"]) { edges { node { block { height } bundledIn { id } } } } }"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/graphql

# Expected output:
# {"data":{"transactions":{"edges":[{"node":{"block":{"height":1461918},"bundledIn":{"id":"ylhb0PqDtG5HwBg00_RYztUl0x2RuKvbNzT6YiNR2JA"}}}]}}}
```

## Starting and Stopping the Gateway with ClickHouse

The gateway ClickHouse container is run as a "profile" in the main docker compose file. That means you must specify the profile when starting or stopping the gateway if you want to include the ClickHouse container in the commands.

### Start Gateway with ClickHouse

To start the gateway with the ClickHouse profile, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up -d
```

This will start all of the containers normally covered by the `docker compose up` command, but will also start the ClickHouse container.

### Stop Gateway with ClickHouse

To stop the gateway with the ClickHouse profile, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse down
```

This will stop all of the containers normally covered by the `docker compose down` command, but will also stop the ClickHouse container.

### Manage ClickHouse Container Only

To start or stop only the ClickHouse container, you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up clickhouse -d
```

and

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse down clickhouse
```

## Useful Docker Commands

Monitor and manage your gateway with ClickHouse using these commands:

```bash
# View all running services
docker ps

# Start gateway with ClickHouse profile
docker compose --profile clickhouse up -d

# Stop gateway with ClickHouse profile
docker compose --profile clickhouse down

# Pull latest images
docker compose --profile clickhouse pull

# Start only ClickHouse container
docker compose --profile clickhouse up clickhouse -d

# Stop only ClickHouse container
docker compose --profile clickhouse down clickhouse

# Follow gateway logs
docker compose logs core -f -n 10

# Follow ClickHouse logs
docker compose --profile clickhouse logs clickhouse -f -n 10

# Check ClickHouse container status
docker compose --profile clickhouse ps clickhouse

# Restart ClickHouse container
docker compose --profile clickhouse restart clickhouse
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have ClickHouse set up for improved query performance, continue building your gateway infrastructure:

# AO Compute Unit (CU) (/build/extensions/compute-unit)

## Overview

An AO Compute Unit (CU) is a critical component in the AO ecosystem responsible for executing AO processes and maintaining their state. CUs serve as the computational backbone of the AO network by:

- **Processing Messages**: CUs receive and process messages sent to AO processes
- **Executing WASM Modules**: CUs run the WebAssembly (WASM) code that defines process behavior
- **Maintaining State**: CUs track and update the state of AO processes
- **Creating Checkpoints**: CUs periodically save process state to the Arweave network as checkpoints

Running a CU alongside your gateway allows you to:

1. Process AO requests locally rather than relying on external services
2. Improve response times for AO-related queries
3. Contribute computational resources to the AO network
4. Ensure your gateway has reliable access to AO functionality

For more detailed information about Compute Units, please refer to the [AO Cookbook: Units](https://cookbook_ao.arweave.net/concepts/units.html#summary).

## System Requirements

Before deploying a CU, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Recommended**: At least 16GB RAM for optimal CU operation
- **Minimum**: 4GB RAM is possible with adjusted memory limits (see resource allocation settings)
- At least 100GB disk space dedicated to CU operation
- These requirements are separate from your gateway requirements

  Running a CU is resource-intensive. Make sure your system has sufficient
  resources to handle both the gateway and the CU. While you can run a CU with
  less than the recommended RAM, you'll need to adjust the memory limits
  accordingly.

## Deploying an AO CU

### Navigate to Gateway Directory

First, navigate to the root directory of your gateway:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/gateway
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.ao.example .env.ao
```

### Default .env.ao.example Contents

The default `.env.ao.example` file contains the following settings:

```
CU_WALLET='[wallet json here]'
PROCESS_CHECKPOINT_TRUSTED_OWNERS=fcoN_xJeisVsPXA-trzVAuIiqO3ydLQxM-L4XbrQKzY
GATEWAY_URL=http://envoy:3000
UPLOADER_URL=http://envoy:3000/bundler
```

These default settings are configured to work with a gateway running on the same machine, but you'll need to modify them as described below.

Open the `.env.ao` file in your preferred text editor:

```bash
nano .env.ao
```

Configure the following settings:

1.  **CU_WALLET**: Replace `'[wallet json here]'` with the JSON from an Arweave wallet.

      The entire JSON must be placed on a single line for proper registration.

2.  **PROCESS_CHECKPOINT_TRUSTED_OWNERS**: This is a comma-separated list of trusted wallet addresses:

    ```
    PROCESS_CHECKPOINT_TRUSTED_OWNERS=fcoN_xJeisVsPXA-trzVAuIiqO3ydLQxM-L4XbrQKzY
    ```

    If you are uploading your own checkpoints, you should add your own CU wallet address after the default value, separated by a comma:

    ```
    PROCESS_CHECKPOINT_TRUSTED_OWNERS=fcoN_xJeisVsPXA-trzVAuIiqO3ydLQxM-L4XbrQKzY,YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE
    ```

    This allows your CU to trust checkpoints from both the official source and your own wallet.

3.  **GATEWAY_URL**: By default, this is set to use your own gateway:

    ```
    GATEWAY_URL=http://envoy:3000
    ```

    A gateway must be set to index all ANS-104 data items from AO or the CU will not operate properly. Most users will want to set this to:

    ```
    GATEWAY_URL=https://arweave.net
    ```

4.  **UPLOADER_URL**: By default, this is set to use a bundler sidecar run by your gateway:

    ```
    UPLOADER_URL=http://envoy:3000/bundler
    ```

      Checkpoints are uploaded to Arweave, so the upload must be paid for. You
      must ensure your wallet has sufficient funds: - If using
      `https://up.arweave.net` (recommended), your CU_WALLET must contain Turbo
      Credits - If using your own bundler or another service, you'll need the
      appropriate token (AR or other) - Without proper funding, checkpoints will
      fail to upload and your CU may not function correctly

    The simplest option for most users is to use:

    ```
    UPLOADER_URL=https://up.arweave.net
    ```

    This requires your CU_WALLET to contain Turbo Credits.

5.  **Optional: Disable Checkpoint Creation**: If you want to disable checkpoint uploads, add:
    ```
    DISABLE_PROCESS_CHECKPOINT_CREATION=true
    ```

### Example of a Completed .env.ao File

Here's an example of what your completed `.env.ao` file might look like with common settings:

```
CU_WALLET='{"kty":"RSA","e":"AQAB","n":"mYM07..."}'
PROCESS_CHECKPOINT_TRUSTED_OWNERS=fcoN_xJeisVsPXA-trzVAuIiqO3ydLQxM-L4XbrQKzY
GATEWAY_URL=https://arweave.net
UPLOADER_URL=https://up.arweave.net
```

After making your changes, save and exit the nano editor:

1. Press `Ctrl+X` to exit
2. Press `Y` to confirm saving changes
3. Press `Enter` to confirm the filename

### Optional Resource Allocation Settings

You can fine-tune the CU's resource usage by adding these optional environment variables:

1.  **PROCESS_WASM_MEMORY_MAX_LIMIT**: Sets the maximum memory limit (in bytes) for WASM processes.

    ```
    PROCESS_WASM_MEMORY_MAX_LIMIT=17179869184  # 16GB (16 * 1024^3)
    ```

    To work with the AR.IO process, `PROCESS_WASM_MEMORY_MAX_LIMIT` must be at least `17179869184` (16GB).

    Note: This doesn't mean your server needs 16GB of RAM. This is the maximum memory limit the CU will support for processes. Most processes don't use their maximum allocated memory.

    You can set this value to 16GB even if your server only has 4GB of RAM. However, if a process requires more memory than your server has available, the CU will fail when evaluating messages that need more memory.

2.  **WASM_EVALUATION_MAX_WORKERS**: Sets the maximum number of worker threads for WASM evaluation.

    ```
    WASM_EVALUATION_MAX_WORKERS=4  # Example: Use 4 worker threads
    ```

      This will default to (available CPUs - 1) if not specified. If you're
      running a gateway and unbundling on the same server, consider setting this
      to 2 or less to avoid overloading your CPU.

3.  **PROCESS_WASM_COMPUTE_MAX_LIMIT**: The maximum Compute-Limit, in bytes, supported for ao processes (defaults to 9 billion)

    ```
    PROCESS_WASM_COMPUTE_MAX_LIMIT=9000000000
    ```

4.  **NODE_OPTIONS**: Sets Node.js memory allocation for the Docker container.
    ```
    NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192  # Example: 8GB for Node.js heap
    ```

  Start with conservative values and monitor performance. You can adjust these
  settings based on your system's capabilities and the CU's performance.

### Start the CU Container

Once your environment file is configured, start the CU container:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.ao -f docker-compose.ao.yaml up -d
```

This command uses the following flags:

- `--env-file .env.ao`: Specifies the environment file to use
- `-f docker-compose.ao.yaml`: Specifies the Docker Compose file to use
- `up`: Creates and starts the containers
- `-d`: Runs containers in detached mode (background)

### Check the Logs

To check the logs of your CU container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml logs -f --tail=20
```

This command uses the following flags:

- `-f`: Follows the log output (continuous display)
- `--tail=20`: Shows only the last 20 lines of logs

Exit the logs by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

## Connecting Your Gateway to the CU

To make your gateway use your local CU:

1. Add the following line to your gateway's `.env` file:

   ```
   AO_CU_URL=http://ao-cu:6363
   ```

   This assumes the CU is running on the same machine as the gateway.

2. Restart your gateway:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

  A CU won't do anything until requests are being made of it. By connecting your
  gateway to the CU, you'll start generating these requests.

### Accessing Your CU

Once properly set up and connected to your gateway, you can access your CU via:

```
https:///ao/cu
```

This endpoint allows you to interact with your CU directly through your gateway's domain.

## Important Notes

- **Initial Processing Time**: A CU will need to process AO history before it can give valid responses. This process can take several hours.

- **Gateway Fallback**: A gateway on release 27 or above will fallback to arweave.net if its default CU is not responding quickly enough, so gateway operations will not be significantly impacted during the initial processing.

- **Monitoring Progress**: Check the CU logs after pointing a gateway at it to watch the process of working through AO history:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml logs -f --tail=20
  ```

- **Resource Usage**: Running a CU is resource-intensive. Monitor your system's performance to ensure it can handle both the gateway and CU workloads.

## Useful Docker Commands

Monitor and manage your AO Compute Unit with these commands:

```bash
# View all running services
docker ps

# Start CU container with environment file
docker compose --env-file .env.ao -f docker-compose.ao.yaml up -d

# Stop CU container
docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml down

# Pull latest CU images
docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml pull

# Follow CU logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml logs -f --tail=20

# Check CU container status
docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml ps

# Restart CU container
docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml restart

# View CU logs without following
docker compose -f docker-compose.ao.yaml logs --tail=50

# Start CU in foreground (for debugging)
docker compose --env-file .env.ao -f docker-compose.ao.yaml up
```

# Grafana (/build/extensions/grafana)

## Overview

AR.IO gateways track extensive performance and operational metrics using [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) sidecar can be deployed to visualize these metrics, providing an easy way to monitor gateway health and performance.

The Grafana sidecar is deployed as a separate Docker container that uses the same network as the gateway, making it simple to integrate with your existing setup.

![Grafana Dashboard](/grafana.png)

## Quick Start

### Deploy Grafana

Deploy the Grafana sidecar using the provided Docker Compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml up -d
```

  This command assumes you're running from the root directory of the gateway. If
  running from a different directory, adjust the path to the docker-compose file
  accordingly.

### Verify Deployment

Check that Grafana is running properly:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml logs -f --tail=25
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to exit the logs. Look for any error messages or permission issues.

### Access Grafana

Navigate to `http://localhost:1024` in your browser to access Grafana.

**Default credentials:**

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

  Updated credentials may be lost if the Grafana sidecar is restarted. Be sure
  to log into Grafana immediately after every startup to ensure Grafana cannot
  be accessed with the default credentials.

## Exposing Dashboard Publicly

To expose your Grafana dashboard externally through your domain, you'll need to configure nginx as a reverse proxy. This requires DNS setup and SSL certificates as covered in the [gateway installation guide](/build/run-a-gateway/quick-start).

  This setup assumes you've already configured DNS, SSL certificates, and nginx
  as described in the [Installation & Setup
  guide](/build/run-a-gateway/quick-start).

### Deploy Grafana Sidecar

First, ensure your Grafana container is running:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml up -d
```

Verify it's accessible locally at `http://localhost:1024`.

### Update Nginx Configuration

Edit your existing nginx configuration file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`) to add the Grafana location block:

```nginx
# Add this block inside your existing HTTPS server block (port 443)
location /grafana/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:1024/grafana/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

Your complete nginx configuration should look like this:

```nginx
# Force redirects from HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name .com *..com;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}

# Forward traffic to your node and provide SSL certificates
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name .com *..com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # Forward AR.IO headers if present in the request
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin $http_x_ar_io_origin;
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin-Node-Release $http_x_ar_io_origin_node_release;
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Hops $http_x_ar_io_hops;
    }

    # Grafana dashboard access
    location /grafana/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:1024/grafana/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Test and Reload Nginx

Validate your nginx configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

If the configuration is valid, reload nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

### Access Your Dashboard

Navigate to `https://.com/grafana/` in your browser to access your Grafana dashboard externally.

**Default credentials:**

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

## Troubleshooting

### Fix Permission Issues

### Method 1: Modify Directory Permissions

The simplest solution is to modify the permissions of the Grafana data directory:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 ./data/grafana
```

  This command assumes you're running from the root directory of the gateway.
  Adjust the path if running from a different directory.

### Method 2: Change Grafana User

Alternatively, modify the `docker-compose.grafana.yaml` file to use root user:

```yaml
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:latest
  user: root
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
```

### Verify Fix

Restart Grafana and check logs:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml restart
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml logs -f
```

### Resolve Connection Problems

### Check Container Status

Verify Grafana is running:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml ps
```

### Check Port Availability

Ensure the port isn't already in use:

```bash
netstat -tulpn | grep :1024
# or
lsof -i :1024
```

### Review Logs

Check for specific error messages:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml logs --tail=50
```

### Fix Configuration Issues

### Validate Nginx Configuration

Test your Nginx configuration:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

### Check Proxy Settings

Ensure proxy headers are correctly configured:

```nginx
location /grafana/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:1024/grafana/;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

### Restart Services

Restart both Nginx and Grafana:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml restart
```

## Security Considerations

  Always change the default admin credentials immediately after first login.
  Default credentials are publicly known and pose a security risk.

### Best Practices

1. **Change Default Password** - Use a strong, unique password
2. **Enable HTTPS** - Use SSL certificates for external access
3. **Restrict Access** - Use firewall rules to limit access
4. **Regular Updates** - Keep Grafana updated to latest version
5. **Backup Configuration** - Export and backup dashboard configurations

# ArNS Marketplace (/build/guides/arns-marketplace)

**ArNS tokens** have the potential to be traded and sold in decentralized marketplaces. ANTs (Arweave Name Tokens) are both smart contracts and transferable tokens, making them valuable digital assets that could be bought, sold, and traded. However, no established marketplace has yet emerged as the preferred platform for ArNS trading.

## Current State of ArNS Trading

**No established marketplace exists yet** - While ANTs are technically transferable tokens, there is currently no widely adopted marketplace specifically for ArNS trading.

**Direct transfers are possible** - You can transfer ANTs directly between wallets, but this requires technical knowledge and direct coordination between buyer and seller.

**Future potential** - As the ArNS ecosystem grows, dedicated marketplaces may emerge to facilitate easier trading of ArNS tokens and domains.

## What Are ANTs?

**Arweave Name Tokens (ANTs)** are:

- **Smart contracts** - Define the rules and functionality of your domain
- **Transferable tokens** - Can be bought, sold, and traded
- **Digital assets** - Represent ownership of ArNS domains
- **Permanent** - Stored on Arweave forever

## How Trading Could Work

### 1. Token Ownership

**When you own an ANT:**

- You control the domain name
- You can update where it points
- You can transfer ownership
- You could potentially sell it to others

### 2. Potential Marketplace Dynamics

**Possible trading mechanisms:**

- **Direct transfers** - Send tokens directly to another wallet
- **Marketplace platforms** - Use dedicated trading platforms (when available)
- **Auction systems** - Bid on available domains (when implemented)
- **Fixed price sales** - Set a price and wait for buyers (when supported)

### 3. Name Characteristics

**What makes ANTs desirable:**

- **Domain length** - Shorter names are more memorable
- **Memorability** - Easy-to-remember names are more useful
- **Brand potential** - Names that could become recognizable
- **Uniqueness** - Creative and distinctive names
- **Content attached** - Domains with established content

## Potential Trading Examples

### Popular Domain Types

**Short names:**

- `ar://ai` - Single letter domains
- `ar://web3` - Industry keywords
- `ar://nft` - Popular terms

**Brandable names:**

- `ar://crypto` - Industry terms
- `ar://decentralized` - Descriptive names
- `ar://permanent` - Arweave-related terms

### Potential Use Cases

**Personal branding** - Use memorable names for your identity

**Project organization** - Create names for different projects

**Content management** - Organize content under specific names

**Community building** - Create recognizable names for communities

## Getting Started

### 1. Acquire ANTs

**Ways to get ANTs:**

- **Register new domains** - Create your own primary names
- **Buy from others** - Purchase existing domains
- **Participate in auctions** - Bid on available names
- **Trade with others** - Exchange domains you own

### 2. Choose Names

**Consider these factors:**

- **Domain length** - Shorter names are more memorable
- **Memorability** - Easy to remember and type
- **Brand potential** - Could become recognizable
- **Current content** - What's already attached to the domain
- **Personal preference** - What fits your needs and style

### 3. Trade Safely

**Best practices:**

- **Verify ownership** - Confirm the seller owns the domain
- **Check domain status** - Ensure it's not expired or locked
- **Use escrow services** - Protect both buyer and seller
- **Document transfers** - Keep records of all transactions

## Benefits

- **Transferable ownership** - Move domains between wallets

# Working With Primary Names (/build/guides/arns-primary-names)

Create **web3 identity** using ArNS names. Primary names allow you to use human-readable names as your identity in the Arweave ecosystem, making it easy for others to find and interact with you.

## What Are Primary Names?

**Primary names** are ArNS names used as identity that:

- **Resolve to wallet addresses** - Link human-readable names to wallet addresses
- **Provide web3 identity** - Give users friendly names for their Arweave identity
- **Are bidirectional** - Can resolve from name to address or address to name
- **Require ownership** - Only the owner of an ArNS name can set it as their primary name
- **Enable secure verification** - Ownership requirement ensures identity authenticity
- **Work across gateways** - Accessible from any AR.IO gateway

## How It Works

### 1. Identity Registration

**Register a primary name:**

- Choose a unique name (e.g., `jonniesparkles`)
- Pay the registration fee
- Link the name to your wallet address
- Use as your web3 identity

### 2. Bidirectional Resolution

**Name to address resolution:**

- `jonniesparkles` → `OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU`
- Others can find your wallet using your name
- Use in dApps and applications

**Address to name resolution:**

- `OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU` → `jonniesparkles`
- Find the name associated with any wallet
- Verify identity in transactions

### 3. Application Integration

**Use in supported apps:**

- **Send tokens to "jonniesparkles"** instead of copying long wallet addresses
- **Display friendly names** as usernames when connecting wallets
- **Apps resolve names** to wallet addresses using the AR.IO SDK
- **Seamless user experience** with human-readable identifiers

## Basic Integration

### Using the AR.IO SDK

**Get a primary name by address:**

```javascript

const ario = new ARIO();

// Get the primary name for a wallet address
const nameData = await ario.getPrimaryName({
  address: "OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU",
});
console.log(nameData.name); // e.g., "jonniesparkles"
```

**Get primary name data:**

```javascript

const ario = new ARIO();

// Get primary name data for a name
const nameData = await ario.getPrimaryName({
  name: "jonniesparkles",
});
console.log(nameData.owner); // e.g., "OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU"
console.log(nameData.name); // e.g., "jonniesparkles"
```

## How Apps Use Primary Names

**Token transfers:**

- Send tokens to "jonniesparkles" instead of copying `OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU`
- Apps automatically resolve the name to the wallet address
- Much more user-friendly than long wallet addresses

**User interfaces:**

- Display "jonniesparkles" as username when wallet is connected
- Show friendly names in transaction histories
- Make interactions more personal and memorable

**Developer integration:**

- Use the [AR.IO SDK](/sdks/ar-io-sdk/primary-names#getprimaryname) to resolve names
- Support primary names in your dApp
- Enhance user experience with human-readable identifiers
- **Trust identity ownership** - Only name owners can set primary names, ensuring secure verification

## Benefits

- **Web3 identity** - Use human-readable names as your identity
- **Easy discovery** - Others can find you by name instead of wallet address
- **Bidirectional resolution** - Resolve name to address or address to name
- **Secure verification** - Only name owners can set primary names, preventing impersonation
- **Permanent ownership** - Own your identity forever
- **App integration** - Works in any app that supports primary names

# ArNS Undernames for Permasite Versioning (/build/guides/arns-undernames-versioning)

Use **ArNS undernames** to organize and version your permanent website components. Undernames allow you to create sub-domains under your main ArNS name, making it easy to manage different versions, pages, and assets.

## What Are Undernames?

**Undernames** are sub-domains under your main ArNS name that can point to different Arweave transactions. They provide a structured way to organize your permanent website content.

**Example structure:**

- `yourname.arweave.dev` - Main site
- `v1_yourname.arweave.dev` - Version 1
- `v2_yourname.arweave.dev` - Version 2
- `api_yourname.arweave.dev` - API endpoints
- `docs_yourname.arweave.dev` - Documentation

## Real-World Example: ArDrive

The ArDrive website uses undernames to organize different components and versions:

```json
{
  "@": {
    "priority": 0,
    "ttlSeconds": 3600,
    "transactionId": "Vrf5_MrC1R-6rAk7o_E52DwOsKhyJmkSUqh0h5q4mDQ",
    "index": 0
  },
  "dapp": {
    "ttlSeconds": 3600,
    "transactionId": "1ubf6cW8T5dYN3COApn8Yii4bA0HKoGeid-z2IjelTo",
    "index": 1
  },
  "home": {
    "ttlSeconds": 900,
    "transactionId": "V9rQR06L1w9eLBHh2lY7o4uaDO6OqBI8j7TM_qjmNfE",
    "index": 2
  },
  "v1_home": {
    "ttlSeconds": 900,
    "transactionId": "YzD_Pm5VAfYpMD3zQCgMUcKKuleGhEH7axlrnrDCKBo",
    "index": 9
  },
  "v2_home": {
    "ttlSeconds": 900,
    "transactionId": "nOXJjj_vk0Dc1yCgdWD8kti_1iHruGzLQLNNBHVpN0Y",
    "index": 10
  },
  "v3_home": {
    "ttlSeconds": 900,
    "transactionId": "YvGRDf0h2F7LCaGPvdH19m5lqbag5DGRnw607ZJ1oUg",
    "index": 11
  }
}
```

**This structure provides:**

- **`@`** - Main site (ardrive.arweave.dev)
- **`dapp`** - Application interface (dapp_ardrive.arweave.dev)
- **`home`** - Homepage (home_ardrive.arweave.dev)
- **`v1_home`** - Version 1 homepage (v1_home_ardrive.arweave.dev)
- **`v2_home`** - Version 2 homepage (v2_home_ardrive.arweave.dev)
- **`v3_home`** - Version 3 homepage (v3_home_ardrive.arweave.dev)

## Use Cases for Undernames

### 1. Website Versioning

**Maintain multiple versions:**

- `v1_yourname.arweave.dev` - Previous version
- `v2_yourname.arweave.dev` - Current version
- `beta_yourname.arweave.dev` - Beta testing
- `staging_yourname.arweave.dev` - Staging environment

### 2. Component Organization

**Separate different parts:**

- `api_yourname.arweave.dev` - API endpoints
- `docs_yourname.arweave.dev` - Documentation
- `assets_yourname.arweave.dev` - Static assets
- `blog_yourname.arweave.dev` - Blog content

### 3. Content Management

**Organize by content type:**

- `home_yourname.arweave.dev` - Homepage
- `about_yourname.arweave.dev` - About page
- `contact_yourname.arweave.dev` - Contact page
- `privacy_yourname.arweave.dev` - Privacy policy

## Benefits of Undername Versioning

**Easy access to versions:**

- Users can access any version directly via URL
- No need to remember transaction IDs
- Clear versioning structure

**Permanent version history:**

- All versions remain accessible forever
- Historical record of your website evolution
- Easy rollback to previous versions

**Organized content:**

- Logical structure for different components
- Easy to manage and update
- Clear separation of concerns

**Transferable with ANT:**

- Undernames transfer with the main ArNS name
- Maintain ownership of all versions
- Sell or transfer entire website structure

## How to Set Up Undernames

**1. Register your main ArNS name:**

- Choose your primary name (e.g., `myapp`)
- Register through [ArNS App](https://arns.app)

**2. Create undernames:**

- Use the ANT interface to add undernames
- Point each undername to different transaction IDs
- Set appropriate TTL values

**3. Deploy different versions:**

- Upload each version to Arweave
- Get transaction IDs for each version
- Update undername records

## Example Implementation

**Deploy version 1:**

```bash
# Deploy to main site
npx permaweb-deploy --arns-name myapp --deploy-folder ./v1-build

# Deploy to v1 undername
npx permaweb-deploy --arns-name myapp --undername v1 --deploy-folder ./v1-build
```

**Deploy version 2:**

```bash
# Deploy to main site
npx permaweb-deploy --arns-name myapp --deploy-folder ./v2-build

# Deploy to v2 undername
npx permaweb-deploy --arns-name myapp --undername v2 --deploy-folder ./v2-build
```

**Access different versions:**

- `myapp.arweave.dev` - Current version
- `v1_myapp.arweave.dev` - Version 1
- `v2_myapp.arweave.dev` - Version 2

## Prerequisites

- Node.js environment
- Arweave wallet with AR tokens
- Crossmint developer account
- Basic understanding of React and JavaScript

## Quick Start

    ### Storage Setup

    Store your NFT image permanently on Arweave using [ArDrive.io](http://ArDrive.io):

        #### Generate AI Image

        **Create an AI-generated image for your NFT:**

        1. Visit [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) or another AI image generation tool
        2. Use a prompt to generate an interesting image for your NFT
        3. Download the generated image to your local machine
        4. Make sure to save it in a common format like PNG or JPG

        #### Upload to Arweave

        **Store the image permanently on Arweave:**

        1. Visit [ArDrive.io](http://ArDrive.io) and log in to your account
        2. Fund your ArDrive wallet if needed (requires AR tokens)
        3. Create a new folder for your NFT project
        4. Drag and drop your AI-generated image into this folder
        5. Wait for the upload to complete and for the transaction to be processed

        #### Get Transaction ID

        **Retrieve the Arweave Transaction ID:**

        1. Click on the uploaded image in your ArDrive folder
        2. Look for the "Transaction ID" or "TX ID" in the file details
        3. Copy this Transaction ID - it looks like `Abc123XYZ...`
        4. Save this Transaction ID - you'll need it for creating your NFT metadata

          **Important:** This Transaction ID is the permanent reference to your image on the Arweave network.

    ### Collection and Template Creation

    Create an ERC-1155 collection and template using Crossmint's API:

        #### Create Account

        **Set up your Crossmint developer account:**

        1. Visit the [Crossmint Staging Console](https://staging.crossmint.com/console)
        2. Sign in and accept the dialog to continue
        3. Note that Crossmint provides two environments:
           - **Staging**: For development and testing (what we'll use first)
           - **Production**: For your final, live application

        #### Get API Key

        **Get a server-side API key:**

        1. After logging in, navigate to the "Integrate" tab
        2. Click on "API Keys" at the top of the page
        3. In the "Server-side keys" section, click "Create new key"
        4. Select the following scopes under "Minting API":
           - `collections.create` - Required for creating a new collection
           - `nfts.create` - Required for minting NFTs
           - `nfts.read` - Needed to read NFT information
        5. Create and save this API key securely

        #### Create Collection

        **Create an ERC-1155 collection:**

        ```javascript
        const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
        const env = "staging"; // Using staging environment for development
        const url = `https://${env}.crossmint.com/api/2022-06-09/collections`;

        const options = {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "accept": "application/json",
            "content-type": "application/json",
            "x-api-key": apiKey,
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            chain: "ethereum-sepolia", // Using Ethereum testnet for development
            fungibility: "semi-fungible", // For ERC-1155 tokens
            metadata: {
              name: "lil dumdumz SFT Collection",
              imageUrl: "https://arweave.net/YOUR_ARWEAVE_TX_ID", // Optional collection image
              description: "A collection of semi-fungible tokens with images stored on Arweave"
            }
          }),
        };

        fetch(url, options)
          .then((res) => res.json())
          .then((json) => {
            console.log("Collection created! Collection ID:", json.id);
            console.log("Save this Collection ID for the next steps");
          })
          .catch((err) => console.error("Error:", err));
        ```

        #### Create Template

        **Create an SFT template:**

        ```javascript
        const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
        const collectionId = "YOUR_COLLECTION_ID";
        const env = "staging";
        const url = `https://${env}.crossmint.com/apis/2022-06-09/collections/${collectionId}/templates`;

        const options = {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "accept": "application/json",
            "content-type": "application/json",
            "x-api-key": apiKey,
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({

          })
          .catch((err) => console.error("Error:", err));
        ```

    ### Frontend Development

    Clone and set up the Zero-to-Arweave starter kit:

        #### Clone Repository

        **Clone the starter kit:**

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/ar-io/crossmint-arweave-example.git
        cd crossmint-arweave-example
        ```

        #### Install Dependencies

        **Install required packages:**

        ```bash

# Storing DePIN Data on Arweave Using Turbo (/build/guides/depin)

DePIN networks require **scalable and cost-effective storage solutions** they can trust. With vast amounts of data generated by decentralized physical infrastructure networks, traditional on-chain storage is prohibitively expensive, yet networks need reliable, long-term access to their device data.

Arweave via AR.IO Network provides **chain-agnostic, permanent and immutable storage** for a one-time fee, ensuring networks can access any device data previously stored and verify it has not been tampered with.

## Getting Started with DePIN Data Storage

    ### Prepare Your Data Structure

    Organize your DePIN device data in a consistent format. Here's an example for environmental sensor data:

    ```json
    {
      "device_id": "airmon-007",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-22T14:31:05Z",
      "location": { "lat": 51.5098, "lon": -0.118 },
      "pm25": 16,
      "co2_ppm": 412,
      "noise_dB": 41.2
    }
    ```

    **Best Practices:**
    - Use consistent field names across all devices
    - Include timestamps in ISO format
    - Add device identifiers for tracking
    - Consider data compression for large datasets

    ### Tag Your Data for Discovery

    Proper tagging is essential for [finding your data](/build/access/find-data) later. Consider these tags for DePIN data:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "App-Name",
      "value": "AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "Device-ID",
      "value": "airmon-007"
    },
    {
      "name": "Device-Type",
      "value": "Environmental-Sensor"
    },
    {
      "name": "Network-Name",
      "value": "AirQuality-Network"
    },
    {
      "name": "Data-Category",
      "value": "Air-Quality"
    },
    {
      "name": "Location",
      "value": "London-UK"
    },
    {
      "name": "Device-Timestamp",
      "value": "2025-09-22T14:31:05Z"
    }
    ```

    **Tagging Strategy:**
    - Use consistent naming conventions
    - Include geographic identifiers
    - Add device type classifications
    - Include data categories for filtering

    For more detailed information on tagging, see our [Tagging documentation](/build/upload/tagging)

    ### Upload to Arweave

    Select the best method for your DePIN network's needs:

        ```typescript
        
        // Initialize with your wallet
        const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
          privateKey: jwk, // Your Arweave wallet
          token: 'arweave'
        })

        // Upload device data
        const result = await turbo.upload({
          data: JSON.stringify(deviceData),
          dataItemOpts: {
            tags: [
              { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" },
              { name: "App-Name", value: "AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0" },
              { name: "Device-ID", value: "airmon-007" },
              { name: "Device-Type", value: "Environmental-Sensor" },
              { name: "Network-Name", value: "AirQuality-Network" },
              { name: "Data-Category", value: "Air-Quality" },
              { name: "Location", value: "London-UK" },
              { name: "Device-Timestamp", value: "2025-09-22T14:31:05Z" }
            ]
          }
        })
        ```

        ```bash
        # Install Turbo CLI
        npm install -g @ardrive/turbo-sdk

        # Upload a single file
        turbo upload-file --file-path sensor-data.json \
          --tag "Content-Type:application/json" \
          --tag "App-Name:AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0" \
          --tag "Device-Type:Environmental-Sensor" \
          --tag "Network-Name:AirQuality-Network" \
          --tag "Data-Category:Air-Quality" \
          --tag "Location:London-UK" \
          --tag "Device-Timestamp:2025-09-22T14:31:05Z"

        # Upload entire folder
        turbo upload-folder --folder-path ./sensor-data \
          --tag "App-Name:AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0" \
          --tag "Network-Name:AirQuality-Network" \
          --tag "Data-Category:Air-Quality" \
          --index-file index.json
        ```

    For more advanced uploading options, see our [Advanced Uploading with Turbo](/build/upload/advanced-uploading-with-turbo) guide, or the [Turbo SDK documentation](/sdks/turbo-sdk) directly.

## Querying Your DePIN Data

    ### Find Your Data

    Use GraphQL to search for your DePIN data by tags and criteria:

    ```graphql
    # Find all data for a specific device, most recent results first
    query {
      transactions(
        tags: [
          { name: "App-Name", values: ["AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0"] }
          { name: "Device-ID", values: ["airmon-007"] }
        ]
        first: 100
        sort: HEIGHT_DESC
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            tags {
              name
              value
            }
            data {
              size
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    ```graphql
    # Find data by location
    query {
      transactions(
        tags: [
          { name: "App-Name", values: ["AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0"] }
          { name: "Location", values: ["London-UK"] }
        ]
        first: 50
      ) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            tags {
              name
              value
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    For more advanced querying options, see our [Find Your Data](/build/access/find-data) documentation.

    ### Access and Use Your Data

    Once you have transaction IDs from your queries, choose how to fetch and process the data:

        **Direct data fetching:**

        ```javascript
        // Example: Process air quality data
        async function processAirQualityData(transactionIds) {
          const results = []

          for (const txId of transactionIds) {
            const response = await fetch(`https://arweave.net/${txId}`)
            const data = await response.json()

            // Process the data
            const processed = {
              Device_ID: data.device_id,
              timestamp: data.timestamp,
              location: data.location,
              pm25: data.pm25,
              co2_ppm: data.co2_ppm,
              noise_dB: data.noise_dB
            }

            results.push(processed)
          }

          return results
        }
        ```

        For more information on fetching data, see our [Fetch Data](/build/access/fetch-data) documentation.

        **Verified data with optimized routing:**

        ```javascript
        import {
          createWayfinderClient,
          PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy,
          FastestPingRoutingStrategy,
          HashVerificationStrategy
        } from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";
        
        const wayfinder = createWayfinderClient({
          ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
          routingStrategy: new PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy({
            preferredGateway: 'https://your-gateway.com',
            fallbackStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500 }),
          }),
          verificationStrategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
            trustedGateways: ['https://arweave.net'],
          }),
          telemetrySettings: {
            enabled: true,
            clientName: 'AirQuality-DePIN-v1.0',
          },
        });

        // Fetch and verify data using ar:// protocol
        async function processVerifiedAirQualityData(transactionIds) {
          const results = []

          for (const txId of transactionIds) {
            const response = await wayfinder.request(`ar://${txId}`)
            const data = await response.json()

            // Process the verified data
            const processed = {
              Device_ID: data.device_id,
              timestamp: data.timestamp,
              location: data.location,
              pm25: data.pm25,
              co2_ppm: data.co2_ppm,
              noise_dB: data.noise_dB,
              noise_level: data.noise_dB,
              verified: true // Data is cryptographically verified
            }

            results.push(processed)
          }

          return results
        }
        ```

# Deploy a dApp with ArDrive Web (/build/guides/deploy-dapp-with-ardrive-web)

Create **permanent dApps** using the ArDrive web interface. This guide shows you how to deploy your dApp or website to the permaweb using ArDrive's user-friendly interface.

## What You'll Learn

- How to deploy dApps using ArDrive web
- Creating manifests for proper file routing
- Assigning friendly ArNS names
- Updating your dApp with new versions

## Prerequisites

**For simple apps and websites:**

- Your dApp files ready for deployment
- ArDrive account (free to create)

**For advanced applications:**

- dApp prepared with hash routing and relative file paths
- Static files built (for frameworks like React)
- Learn more about [preparing your dApp for deployment](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/misc/deploy/)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

    ### Log into ArDrive

    Go to the [ArDrive web app](https://app.ardrive.io/#/sign-in) and log in using your preferred method. If you don't have an account, follow the instructions to create one.

    ### Select or Create a Drive

    Navigate to the drive where you want your project hosted. If you need a new drive:

    - Click the big red "New" button at the top left
    - Create a new drive
    - **Important:** Set the drive to **public** for others to access your dApp

    ### Upload Your Project

    With your drive selected:

    - Click the big red "New" button again
    - Select "Upload Folder"
    - Navigate to your project's root directory (or built directory if required)
    - Select the entire directory to maintain your project's file structure

    ### Confirm Upload

    Review the upload and associated cost. If everything looks correct, click "Confirm".

      **Cost Note:** Uploading to Arweave isn't free, but costs are usually quite small compared to the benefits of permanent hosting.

    ### Create the Manifest

    While ArDrive displays files as a traditional file structure, they don't actually exist that way on Arweave. The manifest acts as a map to all your dApp files:

    - Navigate into your newly created folder by double-clicking it
    - Click the big red "New" button again
    - Select "New Manifest" in the "Advanced" section
    - Name the manifest and save it inside the folder you just created

    ### Get the Data TX ID

    Once the manifest is created:

    - Click on it to expand its details
    - Go to the "Details" tab
    - Find the "Data TX ID" on the bottom right
    - Copy this unique identifier for your dApp

    ### View and Share Your dApp

    Your dApp is now live on the permaweb forever!

    - Append the Data TX ID to an Arweave gateway URL: `https://arweave.net/YOUR-TX-ID`
    - It may take a few minutes for files to propagate through the network
    - Once propagated, your dApp is accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time

    ### Assign a Friendly Name (Optional)

    Make your dApp easier to access with an ArNS name:

    - If you own an ArNS name, you'll be prompted during manifest creation
    - If not, purchase one from [arns.app](https://arns.arweave.net)
    - You can also assign an ArNS name later by clicking the three dots next to any file and selecting "Assign ArNS name"

## Updating Your dApp

Files uploaded to Arweave are **permanent and immutable** - they cannot be changed. However, the [Arweave File System (ArFS)](/build/advanced/arfs) protocol lets you "replace" them with new versions while keeping old ones accessible.

### How Updates Work

**To update your dApp:**

1. **Make your changes** and build the static directory
2. **Upload the entire folder again** to the same location
3. **Follow the same steps** as the original upload
4. **Create a new manifest** with the same name as the old one
5. **The new manifest generates a new TX ID** for the updated dApp

**Important Notes:**

- The old version remains accessible to anyone with the correct TX ID
- Old files won't display in ArDrive unless you view file history
- Each version gets its own unique transaction ID

# Hosting Decentralized Websites (/build/guides/hosting-decentralized-websites)

Create **permanent websites** that can't be censored, taken down, or modified after deployment. Host your content on Arweave and serve it through AR.IO gateways for a truly decentralized web experience.

## What Makes It Different?

**Traditional websites:**

- Hosted on centralized servers
- Can be taken down or censored
- Require ongoing hosting costs
- Single point of failure

**Decentralized websites:**

- Stored permanently on Arweave
- Censorship-resistant
- Pay once, host forever
- Distributed across the network

## How It Works

### 1. Arweave Manifests

[Arweave manifests](/build/upload/manifests) are JSON files that define how your website's files are organized and linked together. They enable:

- **Friendly URLs** - Access files with readable paths instead of transaction IDs
- **Relative linking** - Use `./style.css` instead of full transaction IDs
- **Fallback pages** - Handle 404 errors gracefully
- **File organization** - Structure your website like a traditional site

**Example manifest:**

```json
{
  "manifest": "arweave/paths",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "index": {
    "path": "index.html"
  },
  "fallback": {
    "id": "404-page-transaction-id"
  },
  "paths": {
    "index.html": {
      "id": "main-page-transaction-id"
    },
    "style.css": {
      "id": "css-transaction-id"
    },
    "script.js": {
      "id": "js-transaction-id"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Deployment Tools

**Permaweb Deploy** - [CLI deployment tool](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-deploy) that:

- Uploads your build folder to Arweave using Turbo
- Creates a manifest automatically
- Updates your ArNS domain
- Integrates with GitHub Actions
- Requires `--deploy-folder` and `--arns-name` parameters

**Arlink** - [User-friendly web interface](https://arlink.ar.io/) for:

- Quick website uploads through the browser
- Manifest generation
- ArNS integration

**ArDrive Web** - [User-friendly interface](/build/guides/deploy-dapp-with-ardrive-web) for:

- File management
- Website building
- Deployment workflows

### 3. ArNS Integration

**Primary Names** - [Decentralized domain names](/learn/arns) that:

- Point to your website's manifest
- Provide human-readable URLs
- Can be updated to point to new versions
- Are owned and controlled by you

## Quick Start

**1. Build your website** - Create a static website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**2. Choose a deployment tool:**

```bash
# Using permaweb-deploy (CLI tool)
npm install permaweb-deploy --save-dev
npx permaweb-deploy --deploy-folder ./build --arns-name your-domain

# Using arlink (web interface)
# Visit the arlink website and upload through the browser
```

**3. Get an ArNS domain** - Register a primary name to point to your website

**4. Access your site** - Visit `https://your-domain.arweave.net` or any AR.IO gateway

## Benefits

- **Permanent hosting** - Your website will exist forever
- **Censorship resistance** - Cannot be taken down by authorities
- **Cost efficiency** - Pay once, host forever
- **Global distribution** - Served from multiple AR.IO gateways
- **Version control** - Update your ArNS domain to point to new versions

# Using Turbo SDK with Vanilla HTML (/build/guides/using-turbo-in-a-browser/html)

# Using Turbo SDK with Vanilla HTML

  **Firefox Compatibility**: Some compatibility issues have been reported with
  the Turbo SDK in Firefox browsers. At this time the below framework examples
  may not behave as expected in Firefox.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to integrate the `@ardrive/turbo-sdk` directly into vanilla HTML pages using CDN imports. No build tools, bundlers, or polyfills are required - just modern ES modules support in browsers.

  **Note**: Vanilla HTML implementation is the simplest way to get started with
  the Turbo SDK. It's perfect for prototyping, simple applications, or when you
  want to avoid build complexity.

## Prerequisites

- Modern browser with ES modules support (Chrome 61+, Firefox 60+, Safari 10.1+, Edge 16+)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- HTTPS hosting for production (required for browser wallet integrations)

    Create a basic HTML file with Turbo SDK integration:

    ```html

        Turbo SDK Example
        
          body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            max-width: 800px;
            margin: 0 auto;
            padding: 20px;
          }
          .section {
            margin: 20px 0;
            padding: 20px;
            border: 1px solid #ddd;
            border-radius: 8px;
          }
          .loading {
            color: #666;
            font-style: italic;
          }
          .error {
            color: red;
          }
          .success {
            color: green;
          }
          button {
            background: #007cba;
            color: white;
            border: none;
            padding: 10px 20px;
            border-radius: 4px;
            cursor: pointer;
            margin: 5px;
          }
          button:hover {
            background: #005a87;
          }
          button:disabled {
            background: #ccc;
            cursor: not-allowed;
          }

                )
                .join("");

              ratesDiv.innerHTML = ratesText;
            } catch (error) {

              const fileInput = document.getElementById("fileInput");
              const uploadBtn = document.getElementById("uploadBtn");
              const statusDiv = document.getElementById("uploadStatus");

              if (!fileInput.files.length) {
                statusDiv.innerHTML =
                  'Please select a file';
                return;
              }

              const file = fileInput.files[0];
              uploadBtn.disabled = true;
              statusDiv.innerHTML =
                'Preparing upload...';

              try {
                // Show upload cost first
                const costs = await turbo.getUploadCosts({ bytes: [file.size] });
                const cost = costs[0];

                statusDiv.innerHTML = `
                        Upload cost: ${cost.winc} winc
                        File size: ${file.size.toLocaleString()} bytes
                        Note: This example cannot complete uploads without wallet authentication.
                        See wallet integration examples below for full upload functionality.
                    `;
              } catch (error) {
                statusDiv.innerHTML = `Error: ${error.message}`;
              } finally {
                uploadBtn.disabled = false;
              }
            });

          // Load rates on page load
          loadRates();

    ```

    Select the appropriate CDN import method for your needs:

      **Use esm.sh for best compatibility**: The `unpkg.com` CDN has known issues
      with ES module exports for complex packages like Turbo SDK.

    **Latest Version (Recommended for Development)**
    ```javascript
        ```

    **Specific Version (Recommended for Production)**
    ```javascript
        ```

    **Alternative CDN Providers**
    ```javascript
    // jsDelivr
    
    // SkyPack
    
    // unpkg.com (not recommended - has ES module issues)
        ```

    Connect your browser wallet to enable file uploads:

      **Never expose private keys in browser applications!** Always use browser
      wallet integrations.

    **Uploading with Wander**

      **Deprecation Notice**: The signature API used by ArConnect wallets is
      deprecated and will be removed. Visit [Wander wallet

                    );
                    statusDiv.innerHTML = `

                                `;
                  },

              });

              const totalTime = Math.round((Date.now() - uploadStartTime) / 1000);
              // Use original file size for display (result object doesn't contain size info)
              const displayBytes = file.size;

          // Make functions available globally for onclick handlers
          window.connectWanderWallet = connectWanderWallet;
          window.uploadFile = uploadFile;

    ```

    Browser wallet integrations require HTTPS in production:

    ```html

    ```

    Configure CSP headers to allow CDN imports:

    ```html
    
    ```

    Implement comprehensive error handling:

    ```javascript
    // Network error handling
    async function robustApiCall(apiFunction, retries = 3) {
      for (let i = 0; i 
            setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * Math.pow(2, i))
          );
        }
      }
    }

    // Usage example
    const rates = await robustApiCall(() => turbo.getFiatRates());
    ```

    Optimize for production environments:

    ```html

            // Production code here
    
    ```

## Best Practices

### 1. User Experience

- **Loading States**: Always show loading indicators during API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Provide clear error messages with recovery options
- **Progress Tracking**: Show upload progress for large files
- **Wallet Detection**: Guide users to install wallets if missing

### 2. Security

- **Never expose private keys** in browser applications
- **Validate user inputs** before API calls
- **Use HTTPS** for all production deployments
- **Implement CSP headers** to prevent XSS attacks

### 3. Performance

- **Cache API responses** where appropriate (rates, costs)
- **Use specific CDN versions** in production
- **Implement retry logic** for network failures
- **Optimize file handling** for large uploads

### 4. Development

- **Use development endpoints** during testing
- **Test wallet integrations** across different browsers
- **Validate upload functionality** with small files first
- **Monitor API rate limits** and implement backoff

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### CDN Import Errors

If you encounter errors like:

- `The requested module does not provide an - Module resolution failures

**Solution**: Use `esm.sh` instead of `unpkg.com`:

```javascript
// ❌ Problematic

// ✅ Working
```

### Function Scope Issues

If onclick handlers throw `ReferenceError: function is not defined`:

**Solution**: Use explicit global assignment:

```javascript
// ❌ Problematic
window.myFunction = async function() { ... }

// ✅ Working
async function myFunction() { ... }
window.myFunction = myFunction;
```

### Upload Result Properties

If upload results have undefined properties:

**Solution**: Use original file size for display:

```javascript
// ❌ Problematic - these properties don't exist in result object
const totalBytes = result.totalBytes || result.dataSizeBytes;

// ✅ Correct - use original file size
const displayBytes = originalFile.size;

// Available result properties: id, timestamp, winc, version,
// deadlineHeight, dataCaches, fastFinalityIndexes, public, signature, owner
```

### Upload Cost Properties

If cost calculations fail:

**Solution**: Use correct cost object structure:

```javascript
// ❌ Problematic - adjustedBytes doesn't exist in cost objects
const cost = costs[0];
console.log(`Adjusted: ${cost.adjustedBytes.toLocaleString()}`);

// ✅ Correct - use available properties
const cost = costs[0];
console.log(`Cost: ${cost.winc} winc`);
console.log(`File size: ${originalFile.size.toLocaleString()} bytes`);
// Available cost properties: winc (string), adjustments (array)
```

## Testing Your Implementation

### 1. Basic Functionality Test

```javascript
// Test CDN import
console.log("Testing Turbo SDK import...");
const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated();
console.log("✅ SDK imported successfully");

// Test rate fetching
const rates = await turbo.getFiatRates();
console.log("✅ Rates fetched:", rates);
```

### 2. Wallet Integration Test

- Connect to MetaMask/Wander wallet
- Verify address display
- Test small file upload ( {
    // Actual structure:
    {
      processedBytes: 4326,          // number - bytes processed so far
      totalBytes: 8652,              // number - total bytes to process
      step: "signing"                // string - current step: "signing" or "upload"
    }
  }
}
```

# Using Turbo SDK with Next.js

  **Firefox Compatibility**: Some compatibility issues have been reported with
  the Turbo SDK in Firefox browsers. At this time the below framework examples
  may not behave as expected in Firefox.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to configure the `@ardrive/turbo-sdk` in a Next.js application with proper polyfills for client-side usage. Next.js uses webpack under the hood, which requires specific configuration to handle Node.js modules that the Turbo SDK depends on.

  **Polyfills**: Polyfills are required when using the Turbo SDK in Next.js
  applications. The SDK relies on Node.js modules like `crypto`, `buffer`,
  `process`, and `stream` that are not available in the browser by default.

## Prerequisites

- Next.js 13+ (with App Router or Pages Router)
- Node.js 18+
- Basic familiarity with Next.js configuration

    Install the main Turbo SDK package:

    ```bash
    npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
    ```

    Add required polyfill packages for browser compatibility:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev crypto-browserify stream-browserify process buffer
    ```

      **Wallet Integration Dependencies**: The Turbo SDK includes
      `@dha-team/arbundles` as a peer dependency, which provides the necessary
      signers for browser wallet integration (like `InjectedEthereumSigner` and
      `ArconnectSigner`). You can import these directly without additional
      installation.

    Create or update your `next.config.js` file to include the necessary polyfills:

    ```javascript
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
        // Only configure polyfills for client-side bundles
        if (!isServer) {
          config.resolve.fallback = {
            ...config.resolve.fallback,
            crypto: require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
            stream: require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
            buffer: require.resolve("buffer"),
            process: require.resolve("process/browser"),
            fs: false,
            net: false,
            tls: false,
          };

          // Provide global process and Buffer
          config.plugins.push(
            new config.webpack.ProvidePlugin({
              process: "process/browser",
              Buffer: ["buffer", "Buffer"],
            })
          );
        }

        return config;
      },
    };

    module.exports = nextConfig;
    ```

    If you're using TypeScript, update your `tsconfig.json` to include proper module resolution:

    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "moduleResolution": "bundler",
        "lib": ["es2015", "dom", "dom.iterable"]
        // ... other options
      }
    }
    ```

    **TypeScript Wallet Types**

    Create a `types/wallet.d.ts` file to properly type wallet objects:

    ```typescript
    // types/wallet.d.ts
    interface Window {
      ethereum?: {
        request: (args: { method: string; params?: any[] }) => Promise;
        on?: (event: string, handler: (...args: any[]) => void) => void;
        removeListener?: (event: string, handler: (...args: any[]) => void) => void;
        isMetaMask?: boolean;
      };
      arweaveWallet?: {
        connect: (permissions: string[]) => Promise;
        disconnect: () => Promise;
        getActiveAddress: () => Promise;
        getPermissions: () => Promise;
        sign: (transaction: any) => Promise;
        getPublicKey: () => Promise;
      };
    }
    ```

    Select between MetaMask or Wander wallet integration:

      **Never expose private keys in browser applications!** Always use browser
      wallet integrations for security.

    Create a React component for MetaMask wallet integration:

      For MetaMask integration, you'll need to use `InjectedEthereumSigner` from
      `@dha-team/arbundles`, which is available as a peer dependency through the
      Turbo SDK.

    ```tsx
    "use client";

          const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
      const [address, setAddress] = useState("");
      const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
      const [uploadResult, setUploadResult] = useState(null);

      const connectMetaMask = useCallback(async () => {
        try {
          if (!window.ethereum) {
            alert("MetaMask is not installed!");
            return;
          }

          // Request account access
          await window.ethereum.request({
            method: "eth_requestAccounts",
          });

          // Get the current account
          const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
            method: "eth_accounts",
          });

          if (accounts.length > 0) {
            setAddress(accounts[0]);
            setConnected(true);

            // Log current chain for debugging
            const chainId = await window.ethereum.request({
              method: "eth_chainId",
            });
            console.log("Connected to chain:", chainId);
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Failed to connect to MetaMask:", error);
        }
      }, []);

      const uploadWithMetaMask = async (event) => {
        const file = event.target.files?.[0];
        if (!file || !connected) return;

        setUploading(true);

        try {
          // Create a provider wrapper for InjectedEthereumSigner
          const providerWrapper = {
            getSigner: () => ({
              signMessage: async (message: string | Uint8Array) => {
                const accounts = await window.ethereum!.request({
                  method: "eth_accounts",
                });
                if (accounts.length === 0) {
                  throw new Error("No accounts available");
                }

                // Convert message to hex if it's Uint8Array
                const messageToSign =
                  typeof message === "string"
                    ? message
                    : "0x" +
                      Array.from(message)
                        .map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
                        .join("");

                return await window.ethereum!.request({
                  method: "personal_sign",
                  params: [messageToSign, accounts[0]],
                });
              },
            }),
          };

          // Create the signer using InjectedEthereumSigner
          const signer = new InjectedEthereumSigner(providerWrapper);
          const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({
            signer,
            token: "ethereum", // Important: specify token type for Ethereum
          });

          // Upload file with progress tracking
          const result = await turbo.uploadFile({
            fileStreamFactory: () => file.stream(),
            fileSizeFactory: () => file.size,
            dataItemOpts: {
              tags: [

                  `${step}: ${Math.round((processedBytes / totalBytes) * 100)}%`
                );
              },
              onError: ({ error, step }) => {
                console.error(`Error during ${step}:`, error);
                console.error("Error details:", JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
              },
            },
          });

          setUploadResult(result);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Upload failed:", error);
          console.error("Error details:", JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
          alert(`Upload failed: ${error.message}`);
        } finally {
          setUploading(false);
        }
      };

      return (
        
          MetaMask Upload

          {!connected ? (

          )}
        
      );
    }
    ```

    Create a React component for Wander wallet integration:

    ```tsx
    "use client";

          const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
      const [address, setAddress] = useState("");
      const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);

      );
    }
    ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Errors

If you encounter build errors related to missing modules:

1. **"Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'"**
   - Ensure `fs: false` is set in your webpack fallback configuration

2. **"process is not defined"**
   - Make sure you have the `ProvidePlugin` configuration for process

3. **"Buffer is not defined"**
   - Verify the Buffer polyfill is properly configured in `ProvidePlugin`

### Runtime Errors

1. **"crypto.getRandomValues is not a function"**
   - This usually indicates the crypto polyfill isn't working. Double-check your webpack configuration.

2. **"TypeError: e.startsWith is not a function"**
   - This indicates incorrect signer usage. For MetaMask integration, use `InjectedEthereumSigner` from `@dha-team/arbundles`, not `EthereumSigner`.
   - `EthereumSigner` expects a private key string, while `InjectedEthereumSigner` expects a provider wrapper.

3. **"No accounts available" during wallet operations**
   - Ensure the wallet is properly connected before attempting operations
   - Add validation to check account availability after connection

4. **Message signing failures with wallets**
   - For `InjectedEthereumSigner`, ensure your provider wrapper correctly implements the `getSigner()` method
   - Handle both string and Uint8Array message types in your `signMessage` implementation
   - Use MetaMask's `personal_sign` method with proper parameter formatting

5. **Server-side rendering issues**
   - Always use `'use client'` directive for components that use the Turbo SDK
   - Consider dynamic imports with `ssr: false` for complex cases:

```tsx

const TurboUploader = dynamic(() => import("./TurboUploader"), {
  ssr: false,
});
```

### Wallet Integration Issues

1. **Incorrect Signer Import**

   ```tsx
   // ❌ INCORRECT - For Node environments
   
   // ✅ CORRECT - For browser wallets
      ```

2. **Provider Interface Mismatch**

   ```tsx
   // ❌ INCORRECT - window.ethereum doesn't have getSigner()
   const signer = new InjectedEthereumSigner(window.ethereum);

   // ✅ CORRECT - Use a provider wrapper
   const providerWrapper = {
     getSigner: () => ({
       signMessage: async (message: string | Uint8Array) => {
         // Implementation here
       },
     }),
   };
   const signer = new InjectedEthereumSigner(providerWrapper);
   ```

3. **Missing Dependencies**

   If you encounter import errors for `@dha-team/arbundles`, note that it's available as a peer dependency through `@ardrive/turbo-sdk`. You may need to ensure it's properly resolved in your build process.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Client Components**: Always mark components using the Turbo SDK with `'use client'`

2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for network requests and wallet interactions

3. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive configuration in environment variables:

```javascript
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  env: {
    TURBO_UPLOAD_URL: process.env.TURBO_UPLOAD_URL,
    TURBO_PAYMENT_URL: process.env.TURBO_PAYMENT_URL,
  },
  // ... webpack config
};
```

4. **Bundle Size**: Consider code splitting for large applications to reduce bundle size

5. **Wallet Security**:
   - **Never expose private keys** in client-side code
   - Always use browser wallet integrations (MetaMask, Wander, etc.)
   - Request only necessary permissions from wallets
   - Validate wallet connections before use
   - Handle wallet disconnection gracefully

## Production Deployment Checklist

For production deployments:

1. **Verify polyfills work correctly** in your build environment
2. **Test wallet connections** with various providers (Wander, MetaMask, etc.)
3. **Monitor bundle sizes** to ensure polyfills don't significantly increase your app size
4. **Use environment-specific configurations** for different Turbo endpoints
5. **Implement proper error boundaries** for wallet connection failures
6. **Add loading states** for wallet operations to improve UX
7. **Test across different browsers** to ensure wallet compatibility

## Implementation Verification

To verify your MetaMask integration is working correctly:

1. **Check Console Logs**: After connecting to MetaMask, you should see:

   ```
   Connected to chain: 0x1 (or appropriate chain ID)
   ```

2. **Test Balance Retrieval**: Add this to verify your authenticated client works:

   ```tsx
   // After creating authenticated turbo client
   const balance = await turbo.getBalance();
   console.log("Current balance:", balance);
   ```

3. **Verify Signer Setup**: Your implementation should:
   - Use `InjectedEthereumSigner` from `@dha-team/arbundles`
   - Include a proper provider wrapper with `getSigner()` method
   - Handle both string and Uint8Array message types
   - Use MetaMask's `personal_sign` method

4. **Common Success Indicators**:
   - No `TypeError: e.startsWith is not a function` errors
   - Successful wallet connection and address display
   - Ability to fetch balance without errors
   - Upload operations work with proper MetaMask transaction prompts

# Using Turbo SDK with Vite (/build/guides/using-turbo-in-a-browser/vite)

# Using Turbo SDK with Vite

  **Firefox Compatibility**: Some compatibility issues have been reported with
  the Turbo SDK in Firefox browsers. At this time the below framework examples
  may not behave as expected in Firefox.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to configure the `@ardrive/turbo-sdk` in a Vite application with proper polyfills for client-side usage. Vite provides excellent support for modern JavaScript features and can be easily configured to work with the Turbo SDK through plugins.

  **Polyfills**: Vite simplifies polyfill management compared to other bundlers.
  The `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` plugin handles most of the complexity
  automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Vite 5+
- Node.js 18+
- React 18+ (or your preferred framework)
- Basic familiarity with Vite configuration

    Install the main Turbo SDK package:

    ```bash
    npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
    ```

    Add the Vite node polyfills plugin for browser compatibility:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-node-polyfills
    ```

      **Wallet Integration Dependencies**: The Turbo SDK includes
      `@dha-team/arbundles` as a peer dependency, which provides the necessary
      signers for browser wallet integration (like `InjectedEthereumSigner` and
      `ArconnectSigner`). You can import these directly without additional
      installation.

    Add React and TypeScript dependencies (if using React):

    ```bash
    npm install react react-dom
    npm install --save-dev @vitejs/plugin-react @types/react @types/react-dom
    ```

    Create or update your `vite.config.js` file:

    ```javascript
            
          base: "/",
      plugins: [
        react(),
        nodePolyfills({
          // Enable specific polyfills for Turbo SDK requirements
          include: ["crypto", "stream", "buffer", "process"],
          globals: {
            Buffer: true,
            global: true,
            process: true,
          },
        }),
      ],
      define: {
        // Define globals for browser compatibility
        global: "globalThis",
      },
    });
    ```

    If you're using TypeScript, update your `tsconfig.json`:

    ```json
    {
      "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "ESNext",
        "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ESNext"],
        "allowJs": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
        "strict": true,
        "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
        "module": "ESNext",
        "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
        "isolatedModules": true,
        "jsx": "react-jsx",
        "paths": {
          "buffer/": ["./node_modules/vite-plugin-node-polyfills/shims/buffer"]
        }
      },
      "include": ["src"]
    }
    ```

    **TypeScript Wallet Types**

    Create a `types/wallet.d.ts` file to properly type wallet objects:

    ```typescript
    // types/wallet.d.ts
    interface Window {
      ethereum?: {
        request: (args: { method: string; params?: any[] }) => Promise;
        on?: (event: string, handler: (...args: any[]) => void) => void;
        removeListener?: (event: string, handler: (...args: any[]) => void) => void;
        isMetaMask?: boolean;
      };
      arweaveWallet?: {
        connect: (permissions: string[]) => Promise;
        disconnect: () => Promise;
        getActiveAddress: () => Promise;
        getPermissions: () => Promise;
        sign: (transaction: any) => Promise;
        getPublicKey: () => Promise;
      };
    }
    ```

    Select between MetaMask or Wander wallet integration:

      **Never expose private keys in browser applications!** Always use browser
      wallet integrations for security.

    Create a React component for MetaMask wallet integration:

    ```tsx
            
          const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
      const [address, setAddress] = useState("");
      const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
      const [uploadResult, setUploadResult] = useState(null);

      const connectMetaMask = useCallback(async () => {
        try {
          if (!window.ethereum) {
            alert("MetaMask is not installed!");
            return;
          }

          // Request account access
          await window.ethereum.request({
            method: "eth_requestAccounts",
          });

          // Get the current account
          const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({
            method: "eth_accounts",
          });

          if (accounts.length > 0) {
            setAddress(accounts[0]);
            setConnected(true);

            // Log current chain for debugging
            const chainId = await window.ethereum.request({
              method: "eth_chainId",
            });
            console.log("Connected to chain:", chainId);
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Failed to connect to MetaMask:", error);
        }
      }, []);

      const uploadWithMetaMask = async (event) => {
        const file = event.target.files?.[0];
        if (!file || !connected) return;

        setUploading(true);

        try {
          // Create a provider wrapper for InjectedEthereumSigner
          const providerWrapper = {
            getSigner: () => ({
              signMessage: async (message: string | Uint8Array) => {
                const accounts = await window.ethereum!.request({
                  method: "eth_accounts",
                });
                if (accounts.length === 0) {
                  throw new Error("No accounts available");
                }

                // Convert message to hex if it's Uint8Array
                const messageToSign =
                  typeof message === "string"
                    ? message
                    : "0x" +
                      Array.from(message)
                        .map((b) => b.toString(16).padStart(2, "0"))
                        .join("");

                return await window.ethereum!.request({
                  method: "personal_sign",
                  params: [messageToSign, accounts[0]],
                });
              },
            }),
          };

          // Create the signer using InjectedEthereumSigner
          const signer = new InjectedEthereumSigner(providerWrapper);
          const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({
            signer,
            token: "ethereum", // Important: specify token type for Ethereum
          });

          // Upload file with progress tracking
          const result = await turbo.uploadFile({

                  `${step}: ${Math.round((processedBytes / totalBytes) * 100)}%`
                );
              },
              onError: ({ error, step }) => {
                console.error(`Error during ${step}:`, error);
                console.error("Error details:", JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
              },
            },
          });

          setUploadResult(result);
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Upload failed:", error);
          console.error("Error details:", JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
          alert(`Upload failed: ${error.message}`);
        } finally {
          setUploading(false);
        }
      };

      return (
        
          MetaMask Upload

          {!connected ? (
            
              Connect MetaMask

      );
    }
    ```

    Create a React component for Wander wallet integration:

    ```tsx
        
          const [connected, setConnected] = useState(false);
      const [address, setAddress] = useState("");
      const [uploading, setUploading] = useState(false);
      const [uploadResult, setUploadResult] = useState(null);

            return;
          }

          // Required permissions for Turbo SDK

          ];

          // Connect to wallet
          await window.arweaveWallet.connect(permissions);

          // Get wallet address
          const walletAddress = await window.arweaveWallet.getActiveAddress();

1. **"global is not defined"**
   - Ensure you have `global: 'globalThis'` in your Vite config's `define` section

2. **Buffer polyfill issues**
   - Make sure `vite-plugin-node-polyfills` is properly configured with Buffer globals
   - Add the buffer path mapping in your `tsconfig.json`

3. **Module resolution errors**
   - Use `moduleResolution: "Bundler"` in TypeScript configuration
   - Ensure you're importing from `@ardrive/turbo-sdk/web` for browser usage

### Runtime Errors

1. **"process is not defined"**
   - Enable process globals in the node polyfills plugin configuration

2. **Wallet integration errors**
   - For MetaMask, use `InjectedEthereumSigner` from `@dha-team/arbundles`
   - For Wander wallet, use `ArconnectSigner` from the Turbo SDK
   - Always check wallet availability before attempting connection

### Development Experience

1. **Hot reload issues with wallet connections**
   - Wallet state may not persist across hot reloads
   - Consider using localStorage to persist connection state

2. **Console warnings about dependencies**
   - Some peer dependency warnings are normal for wallet libraries
   - Focus on runtime functionality rather than dependency warnings

## Best Practices

1. **Development vs Production**
   - Use debug logs during development: `TurboFactory.setLogLevel('debug')`
   - Remove debug logs in production builds

2. **Error Handling**
   - Always wrap wallet operations in try-catch blocks
   - Provide meaningful error messages to users
   - Log detailed error information for debugging

3. **Performance**
   - Initialize Turbo clients once and reuse them
   - Consider lazy loading wallet integration components
   - Use loading states for better user experience

4. **Security**
   - Never expose private keys in browser applications
   - Always validate wallet connections before operations
   - Use secure wallet connection methods in production

## Production Deployment Checklist

For production builds:

1. **Build optimization**
   - Vite automatically optimizes builds with tree shaking
   - Polyfills are only included when needed

2. **Testing**
   - Test wallet connections across different browsers
   - Verify polyfills work in production builds
   - Test with actual wallet extensions

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor bundle sizes to ensure polyfills don't bloat your app
   - Set up error tracking for wallet connection failures

## Implementation Verification

To verify your Vite setup is working correctly:

1. **Check Development Server**: Start your dev server and verify no polyfill errors
2. **Test Wallet Connections**: Ensure both MetaMask and Wander wallet integrations work
3. **Build Verification**: Run `npm run build` and check for any build errors
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Use `vite-bundle-analyzer` to inspect your bundle size

## Ready to Deploy?

Whether you're exploring gateway capabilities or ready to join the network, we have resources to help:

# Join the Network (/build/run-a-gateway/join-the-network)

Take control of the permanent web by running your own **AR.IO Gateway**. Join the decentralized network that powers the permaweb and earn rewards for providing infrastructure services.

## Prerequisites

    ### Running Gateway Required

    You must have a fully functional AR.IO Gateway running with a custom domain and SSL certificates. 
    
    **Don't have a gateway yet?** Follow our [Production Setup Guide](/build/run-a-gateway/quick-start#production-setup-with-custom-domain) to get your gateway running with proper DNS configuration.

    **Requirements:**
    - Gateway accessible via your custom domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
    - SSL certificates properly configured
    - ArNS subdomain resolution working
    - Gateway responding to test requests

    ### Minimum Stake Requirement

    To join the network as a gateway operator, you need **10,000 ARIO tokens** as the minimum stake requirement.

    **Need to acquire ARIO tokens?** Visit our [Get the Token guide](/learn/token/get-the-token) to learn about all available methods including exchanges, DEXs, and network participation.

    **Acquisition Options:**
    - Purchase on centralized exchanges like Gate.io
    - Trade on decentralized exchanges (Dexi, Botega, Vento)
    - Use Wander wallet for easy exchange and swap functionality
    - Earn through network participation and community programs

## Join the Network

Choose your preferred method to register your gateway:

    ### Visit the Network Portal

    Go to [gateways.ar.io](https://gateways.ar.io/#/gateways) to access the AR.IO Network Portal.

    The portal shows all active gateways on the network and provides the interface to register your own gateway.

    ### Connect Your Wallet

    Click the "Start your own gateway" button to begin the registration process. You'll be prompted to connect your wallet.

    Choose your preferred wallet (Wander, Metamask, or Beacon) to connect.

      Use the same wallet address that you configured in your gateway's `AR_IO_WALLET` environment variable. This wallet will be the owner of your gateway registration.

    ### Fill Out Gateway Information

    Complete the gateway registration form with your gateway details:

    **Required Fields:**
    - **Label**: A display name for your gateway (e.g., "My New Gateway")
    - **Address**: Your gateway's domain with port (e.g., `https://fastandfurious.io:443`)
    - **Observer Wallet**: The public address of your observer wallet
    - **Properties ID**: Transaction ID of your gateway properties
    - **Stake (ARIO)**: Minimum stake required (typically 10,000 ARIO)
    - **Delegated Staking**: Enable to allow others to delegate stake to your gateway
    - **Minimum Delegated Stake**: Set minimum delegation amount (e.g., 100 ARIO)
    - **Reward Share Ratio**: Percentage of rewards shared with delegators (e.g., 50%)
    - **Note**: Additional information about your gateway (e.g., "AR.IO rules!")

    ### Confirm Registration

    Review all information carefully and click "Confirm" to submit your gateway registration to the network.

    **What happens next:**
    - Your gateway will be added to the Gateway Address Registry
    - Observers will start observing your gateway at the next Epoch (day)
    - You will begin to receive rewards based on your gateway performance
    - You can monitor your gateway's performance in the portal

    **Confirm your gateway registration:**

    Your gateway should now be viewable at `gateways.ar.io/#/` with the wallet address you used to join.

    This dashboard shows your gateway's information, stats, and performance metrics including join date, uptime, operator stake, and delegated stake details.

        ### Install the AR.IO CLI

        First, install the AR.IO CLI tool if you haven't already:

        ```npm
        npm install -g @ar.io/sdk
        ```

        ### Run the Join Network Command

        Use the `ar.io join-network` command with your gateway configuration:

        ```bash
        ar.io join-network \
          --wallet-file ./path/to/wallet.json \
          --qty 10000000000 \
          --auto-stake true \
          --allow-delegated-staking true \
          --min-delegated-stake 100000000 \
          --delegate-reward-share-ratio 10 \
          --label "My Test Gateway" \
          --note "Test gateway for development" \
          --observer-wallet 0VE0wIhDy90WiQoV3U2PeY44FH1aVetOoulPGqgYukj \
          --fqdn my-gateway.example.com \
          --port 443 \
          --protocol https \
          --mainnet
        ```

          The wallet file used in the `--wallet-file` parameter must be the same wallet configured in your AR.IO Gateway's `AR_IO_WALLET` environment variable. This ensures your gateway registration is properly linked to your running gateway instance.

        **Parameter explanations:**
        - `--qty 10000000000` - 10,000 ARIO in mARIO (multiply by 1,000,000)
        - `--min-delegated-stake 100000000` - 100 ARIO in mARIO
        - `--delegate-reward-share-ratio 10` - 10% shared with delegators
        - `--observer-wallet` - Must match your gateway's OBSERVER_WALLET env var
        - `--fqdn` - Your gateway's domain name

        ### Verify Registration

        After running the command, verify your gateway registration using the CLI:

        ```bash
        ar.io get-gateway 0VE0wIhDy90WiQoV3U2PeY44FH1aVetOoulPGqgYukj
        ```

        The status should show `joined` when your gateway is successfully registered.

        You can also verify by visiting: `gateways.ar.io/#/`

        The CLI will output transaction details and your gateway should appear in the network portal within a few minutes.

## What Happens After Registration

After joining the network:

- Your gateway will be monitored by the Observer system
- You'll earn rewards for providing reliable service
- You can monitor your gateway's performance and earnings in the portal
- You may be selected as an Observer to help monitor other gateways

## Next Steps

Your gateway is now part of the AR.IO Network! Here are some next steps to maximize your participation:

# Content Moderation (/build/run-a-gateway/manage/content-moderation)

## Overview

Arweave is a network designed for permanent storage of data. It is a practical impossibility for data to be wholly removed from the network once it has been uploaded.

The AR.IO Network has adopted Arweave's voluntary content moderation model, whereby every participant of the network has the autonomy to decide which content they want to (or can legally) store, serve, and see. Each gateway operating on the network has the right and ability to blocklist any content, ArNS name, or address that is deemed in violation of its content policies or is non-compliant with local regulations.

Gateway operators may set content to be blocked by their gateway by submitting a `PUT` request to their gateway defining the content to be blocked. This requires that the `ADMIN_API_KEY` environmental variable to be set in order to authenticate the moderation request.

The simplest method for submitting moderation requests to a gateway is to use `curl` in a terminal.

## Quick Start

### Set Up Admin API Key

Configure your admin API key in your `.env` file:

```bash
# Set a secure admin API key
ADMIN_API_KEY=your_secure_admin_key_here
```

  Choose a strong, unique admin API key. This key provides administrative access
  to your gateway and should be kept secure.

### Test API Access

Verify your admin API key is working:

```bash
# Test admin endpoint access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_secure_admin_key_here" \
  http://localhost:3000/ar-io/admin/debug
```

### Block Your First Content

Block a specific transaction ID:

```bash
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:3000/ar-io/admin/block-data' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_secure_admin_key_here' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": "3lyxgbgEvqNSvJrTX2J7CfRychUD5KClFhhVLyTPNCQ",
  "notes": "Content violates our policies",
  "source": "Manual Review"
}'
```

## Authentication

Moderation requests must contain the gateway's `ADMIN_API_KEY` in the request Header, as `Authorization: Bearer`.

For example, if a gateway's `ADMIN_API_KEY` is set to `secret`, any request must contain `Authorization: Bearer secret` in the Header.

## Block Data

Specific data items can be blocked by a gateway operator by submitting a `PUT` request containing a json object with three keys:

- **id**: The Arweave transaction Id of the data item to be blocked.
- **notes**: Any note the gateway operator wants to leave him/herself as to the reason the content is blocked.
- **source**: A note as to where the content was identified as requiring moderation. i.e. a public block list.

Requests to block data must be submitted to the gateway's `/ar-io/admin/block-data` endpoint.

```bash {{ title: 'curl' }}
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:3000/ar-io/admin/block-data' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer secret' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": "3lyxgbgEvqNSvJrTX2J7CfRychUD5KClFhhVLyTPNCQ",
  "notes": "This content is offensive",
  "source": "Public Block list"
}'
```

### Unblock Data

At this time, blocked data items can only be unblocked by manually deleting the corresponding row from the `data/sqlite/moderation.db` database.
The Arweave transaction Id of the blocked data item is stored in the database as raw bytes, which sqlite3 accepts as a BLOB (Binary Large OBject), and so cannot be accessed easily using the original transaction Id, which is a base64url.
Sqlite3 is able to interact with a hexadecimal representation of the BLOB, by using a BLOB literal. To do so, wrap a hexadecimal representation of the Arweave transaction Id in single quotes, and prepend an `X` i.e. `X'de5cb181b804bea352bc9ad35f627b09f472721503e4a0a51618552f24cf3424'`.

Where possible, consider using the `notes` or `source` values to identify rows for deletion rather than the `id`.

```bash {{ title: 'id' }}
sqlite3 data/sqlite/moderation.db "DELETE FROM blocked_ids WHERE id=X'de5cb181b804bea352bc9ad35f627b09f472721503e4a0a51618552f24cf3424';"
# Note that the id in this command is a BLOB literal using the hexadecimal representation of the Arweave transaction Id, not the transaction Id in its normal base64url format
```

```bash {{ title: 'source' }}
sqlite3 data/sqlite/moderation.db "DELETE FROM blocked_ids WHERE block_source_id = (SELECT id FROM block_sources WHERE name='Public Block List');"
# This command uses a subquery to look up the id in block_sources where name='Public Block List'
# This command will unblock ALL data items marked with this source value
```

## Block ArNS Name

ArNS names can be blocked so that a gateway will refuse to serve their associated content even if the name holder updates the Arweave transaction Id that the name points at.

This is done via an authenticated `PUT` request to the endpoint `/ar-io/admin/block-name` containing a json object with three keys:

- **name**: The ArNS name to be blocked.
- **notes**: Any note the gateway operator wants to leave him/herself as to the reason the content is blocked.
- **source**: A note as to where the content was identified as requiring moderation. i.e. a public block list.

```bash {{ title: 'curl'}}
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:3000/ar-io/admin/block-name' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer secret' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "i-bought-a-potato",
  "notes": "Potatoes are offensive",
  "source": "Public Block list"
}'
```

  For moderation purposes, each [undername](/learn/arns) of an ArNS name
  is treated as a separate name and must be moderated separately.

### Unblock ArNS Name

Gateway operators can unblock ArNS names that were previously blocked.

This is done via an authenticated `PUT` request to the endpoint `/ar-io/admin/unblock-name` containing a json object with a single key:

- **name**: The ArNS name to be unblocked

```bash {{title: 'curl'}}
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:3000/ar-io/admin/unblock-name' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer secret' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "name": "i-bought-a-potato",
}'
```

# Gateway Filters (/build/run-a-gateway/manage/filters)

Configure your AR.IO Gateway to efficiently process and index only the data you need. This comprehensive guide covers advanced filtering techniques, performance optimization, and real-world use cases.

## Overview

The AR.IO Gateway uses a flexible JSON-based filtering system to control data processing and indexing. The system provides precise control over which bundles are processed and which data items are indexed for querying.

## Understanding the Filtering System

The AR.IO Gateway uses two primary filters to control data processing:

1. **ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER** - Controls which bundles are processed and unbundled
2. **ANS104_INDEX_FILTER** - Controls which data items from unbundled bundles are indexed for querying

  By default, gateways process no bundles and index no data items. You must
  explicitly configure filters to start processing data.

## Core Environment Variables

### Configure Data Management

Optimize data storage and processing:

```bash
# Number of new data items before flushing to stable storage
DATA_ITEM_FLUSH_COUNT_THRESHOLD=1000

# Maximum time between flushes (in seconds)
MAX_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS=600

# Maximum number of data items to queue for indexing
MAX_DATA_ITEM_QUEUE_SIZE=100000

# Enable background verification
ENABLE_BACKGROUND_DATA_VERIFICATION=true
```

### Set Up GraphQL Configuration

Choose between local-only or proxied queries:

```bash
# For new gateways - proxy to arweave.net for complete index
GRAPHQL_HOST=arweave.net
GRAPHQL_PORT=443

# For local-only queries (uncomment to use)
# GRAPHQL_HOST=
```

## Filter Construction

  While the filters below are displayed on multiple lines for readability, they
  must be stored in the `.env` file as a single line for proper processing.

### Basic Filters

The simplest filters you can use are `"always"` and `"never"` filters. The `"never"` filter is the default behavior and will match nothing, while the `"always"` filter matches everything.

```json {{title: "Never Match"}}
{
  "never": true //default behavior
}
```

```json {{title: "Always Match"}}
{
  "always": true
}
```

### Tag Filters

Tag filters allow you to match items based on their tags in three different ways. You can match exact tag values, check for the presence of a tag regardless of its value, or match tags whose values start with specific text. All tag values are automatically base64url-decoded before matching.

```json {{title: "Exact Match"}}
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "Content-Type",
      "value": "image/jpeg"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json {{title: "Match Tag Name Only"}}
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "App-Name"
    }
  ]
}
```

```json {{title: "Starts With Match"}}
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "Protocol",
      "valueStartsWith": "AO"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Attribute Filters

Attribute filtering allows you to match items based on their metadata properties. The system automatically handles owner public key to address conversion, making it easy to filter by owner address. You can combine multiple attributes in a single filter:

```json {{title: "Basic Attributes"}}
{
  "attributes": {
    "owner_address": "xyz123...",
    "data_size": 1000
  }
}
```

### Nested Bundle Filter

The `isNestedBundle` filter is a specialized filter that checks whether a data item is part of a nested bundle structure. It's particularly useful when you need to identify or process data items in bundles that are contained within other bundles.

```json {{title: "Basic Nested Bundle"}}
{
  "isNestedBundle": true
}
```

**Note**: When processing nested bundles, be sure to include filters that match the nested bundles in both `ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER` and `ANS104_INDEX_FILTER`. The bundle data items (nested bundles) need to be indexed to be matched by the unbundle filter.

### Complex Filters Using Logical Operators

For more complex scenarios, the system provides logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) that can be combined to create sophisticated filtering patterns. These operators can be nested to any depth:

```json {{title: "AND Operation"}}
{
  "and": [
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "App-Name",
          "value": "ArDrive-App"
        }
      ]
    },
    {

          "valueStartsWith": "MyApp"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Real-World Use Cases

### Personal Data Gateway

Perfect for individuals who want to process only their own data:

**Unbundle Filter:**

```json
{
  "and": [
    {
      "not": {
        "or": [
          {
            "tags": [
              {
                "name": "Bundler-App-Name",
                "value": "Warp"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "tags": [
              {
                "name": "Bundler-App-Name",
                "value": "Redstone"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "App-Name",
          "valueStartsWith": "MyApp"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Index Filter:**

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "owner_address": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"
  }
}
```

### Application-Specific Service

Ideal for building services around specific applications:

**Unbundle Filter:**

```json
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "App-Name",
      "valueStartsWith": "MyApp"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Index Filter:**

```json
{
  "or": [
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "ArFS",
          "value": "0.10"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "ArFS",
          "value": "0.11"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "ArFS",
          "value": "0.12"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Content-Type Focused Gateway

For gateways specializing in specific content types:

**Unbundle Filter:**

```json
{
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "Content-Type",
      "valueStartsWith": "image/"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Index Filter:**

```json
{
  "and": [
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "Content-Type",
          "valueStartsWith": "image/"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "attributes": {
        "data_size": 100000
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Worker Configuration

### Understanding Default Worker Settings

The gateway uses sensible defaults that work well for most users:

```bash
# Default values (no need to set unless customizing)
# ANS104_UNBUNDLE_WORKERS=1 (default: 0, or 1 if filters are set)
# ANS104_DOWNLOAD_WORKERS=5 (default: 5)

# Only adjust if you have specific hardware requirements
# or want to optimize for your system's capabilities
```

  **When to Adjust Workers:** Only modify worker counts if you have
  high-performance hardware and want to maximize throughput, or if you're
  experiencing resource constraints and need to reduce load.

### Optimize Data Flushing

Balance between memory usage and database performance:

```bash
# For high-memory systems, increase threshold
DATA_ITEM_FLUSH_COUNT_THRESHOLD=2000

# For low-memory systems, decrease threshold
DATA_ITEM_FLUSH_COUNT_THRESHOLD=500

# Adjust flush interval based on data volume
MAX_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300
```

### Enable Background Processing

```bash
# Enable background verification
ENABLE_BACKGROUND_DATA_VERIFICATION=true

# Enable WAL cleanup for better performance
ENABLE_DATA_DB_WAL_CLEANUP=true
```

## Webhook Filters

There are also two filters available that are used to trigger webhooks. When a transaction is processed that matches one of the webhook filters, the gateway will send a webhook to the specified `WEBHOOK_TARGET_SERVERS` urls containing the transaction data.

```bash
WEBHOOK_INDEX_FILTER=""
WEBHOOK_BLOCK_FILTER=""
```

The `WEBHOOK_INDEX_FILTER` is used to trigger a webhook when a transaction is indexed. The `WEBHOOK_BLOCK_FILTER` is used to trigger a webhook when a block is processed.

## Important Notes

- All tag names and values are base64url-decoded before matching
- Owner addresses are automatically converted from owner public keys
- Empty or undefined filters default to "never match"
- Tag matching requires all specified tags to match
- Attribute matching requires all specified attributes to match
- The filter system supports nested logical operations to any depth, allowing for very precise control over what data gets processed

## Best Practices

### Filter Design

1. **Start Simple** - Begin with basic filters and gradually add complexity
2. **Test Thoroughly** - Use `FILTER_CHANGE_REPROCESS=true` when changing filters
3. **Monitor Performance** - Watch system resources during processing
4. **Document Changes** - Keep track of filter modifications and their effects

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Monitoring** - Check gateway logs for errors and warnings
2. **Resource Cleanup** - Periodically clean up old data and logs
3. **Filter Optimization** - Refine filters based on actual data patterns
4. **Backup Configuration** - Keep copies of working filter configurations

### Troubleshooting

  If your gateway stops processing data after changing filters, check: - Filter
  syntax is valid JSON - Required environment variables are set - Gateway has
  been restarted after changes - System has sufficient resources

# Importing SQLite Database Snapshots (/build/run-a-gateway/manage/index-snapshots)

## Overview

One of the challenges of running an AR.IO Gateway is the initial synchronization time as your gateway builds its local index of the Arweave network. This process can take days or even weeks, depending on your hardware and the amount of data you want to index. To accelerate this process, you can import a pre-synchronized SQLite database snapshot that contains transaction and data item records already indexed.

This guide will walk you through the process of importing a database snapshot into your AR.IO Gateway.

The below instructions are designed to be used in a linux environment. Windows and MacOS users must modify the instructions to use the appropriate package manager/ command syntax for their platform.

Unless otherwise specified, all commands should be run from the root directory of the gateway.

## Quick Start

### Download Database Snapshot

Download the latest database snapshot using BitTorrent:

```bash
transmission-cli "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:62ca6e05248e6df59fac9e38252e9c71951294ed&dn=2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.torrent.eu.org%3A451%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fp4p.arenabg.com%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bt4g.com%3A443%2Fannounce"
```

This downloads a 42.8GB snapshot current to April 23, 2025.

### Extract the Snapshot

Extract the downloaded tarball:

```bash
tar -xzf 2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz
```

This creates a directory with the extracted database files.

### Import the Snapshot

Replace your existing database with the snapshot:

```bash
# Stop the gateway
docker compose down

# Backup existing database (optional)
mkdir sqlite-backup
mv data/sqlite/* sqlite-backup/

# Remove old database
rm data/sqlite/*

# Import new snapshot
mv 2025-04-23-sqlite/* data/sqlite/

# Start the gateway
docker compose up -d
```

## Detailed Instructions

### Obtaining a Database Snapshot

SQLite database snapshots are very large and not easy to incrementally update. For these reasons, AR.IO is distributing them using BitTorrent.

### Install Torrent Client

Install a BitTorrent client. We recommend [transmission-cli](https://github.com/transmission/transmission):

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install transmission-cli

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install transmission-cli

# macOS
brew install transmission-cli
```

### Download Snapshot

Download the latest snapshot using the magnet link:

```bash
transmission-cli "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:62ca6e05248e6df59fac9e38252e9c71951294ed&dn=2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.torrent.eu.org%3A451%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fp4p.arenabg.com%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bt4g.com%3A443%2Fannounce"
```

This will download a snapshot, current to April 23, 2025, of an unbundled data set that includes all data items uploaded via an ArDrive product, including Turbo. The file will be named `2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz` and be approximately 42.8GB in size.

### Consider Seeding

  While continuing to seed the torrent after download is not required, it is
  highly recommended to help ensure the continued availability of the snapshot
  for others, as well as the integrity of the data. Seeding this file should not
  cause any issues with your internet service provider.

### Extracting the Database Snapshot

Once the file has downloaded, you can extract it using the following command.

### Verify Download

Check that the file downloaded completely:

```bash
ls -lh 2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz
# Should show approximately 42.8GB
```

### Extract the Archive

Extract the tarball:

```bash
tar -xzf 2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz
```

Be sure to replace the filename with the actual filename of the snapshot you are using, if not using the example above.

### Verify Extraction

Check that the extraction was successful:

```bash
ls -la 2025-04-23-sqlite/
# Should show SQLite database files
```

This will extract the file into a directory matching the filename, minus the `.tar.gz` extension.

### Importing the Database Snapshot

Once you have an extracted database snapshot, you can import it into your AR.IO gateway by replacing the existing SQLite database files.

  Importing a database snapshot will delete your existing database and replace
  it with the snapshot you are importing.

### Stop the Gateway

Stop your AR.IO gateway:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Backup Existing Database

(Optional) Backup your existing SQLite database files:

```bash
mkdir sqlite-backup
mv data/sqlite/* sqlite-backup/
```

### Remove Old Database

Delete the existing SQLite database files:

```bash
rm data/sqlite/*
```

### Import New Snapshot

Move the snapshot files into the `data/sqlite` directory:

```bash
mv 2025-04-23-sqlite/* data/sqlite/
```

Be sure to replace `2025-04-23-sqlite` with the actual directory name of the extracted snapshot you are using.

### Start the Gateway

Start your AR.IO gateway:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Verifying the Import

The simplest way to verify the import is to check the gateway logs to see what block number is being imported.

### Check Gateway Logs

View the gateway logs to see the current block height:

```bash
docker compose logs -f gateway
```

Look for messages indicating the current block being processed.

### Verify Block Height

The 2025-04-23 snapshot was taken at block `1645229`, so the gateway will start importing blocks after this height if the snapshot was imported successfully.

You should see logs showing blocks being processed starting from block 1645230 or higher.

### Use Grafana (Optional)

You can also use the [Grafana Extension](/build/extensions/grafana) to view the last block imported in a more human readable format.

# Setting Apex Domain Content (/build/run-a-gateway/manage/setting-apex-domain)

Configure your AR.IO Gateway to serve custom content from the apex domain instead of the default Arweave network information. This allows you to customize your gateway's root domain with useful information, project details, or any content you wish to share.

## Overview

Prior to gateway Release 28, the apex domain of a gateway would only display information about the Arweave network. Release 28 introduced two new environment variables that allow a gateway to serve custom content from the apex domain:

- `APEX_TX_ID`: Set to serve content from a specific transaction ID
- `APEX_ARNS_NAME`: Set to serve content from an ArNS name

These variables enable gateway operators to customize their gateway's apex domain with useful information, details about the operator or associated projects, or any other content they wish to share.

## Quick Start

### Choose Your Content Source

Decide how you want to serve your content:

**Option 1: Direct Transaction ID**

- Upload your content to Arweave
- Use the transaction ID directly

**Option 2: ArNS Name (Recommended)**

- Upload your content to Arweave
- Assign your content's transaction ID to an ArNS name
- Use the ArNS name for easier management

### Upload Your Content

Upload your dApp, website, or other content to Arweave using your preferred method:

- **ArDrive** - For simple file uploads
- **Turbo** - For application bundles
- **Direct upload** - For advanced users

### Configure Environment Variable

Add one of these variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Option 1: Direct transaction ID
APEX_TX_ID=your-transaction-id

# Option 2: ArNS name (recommended)
APEX_ARNS_NAME=your-arns-name
```

  You cannot set both variables simultaneously. Providing both variables will
  result in an error.

### Restart Your Gateway

Restart your gateway to apply the changes:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Verify Configuration

Visit your gateway's apex domain to confirm the custom content is being served correctly.

## Configuration Methods

### Using Direct Transaction ID

### Upload Content

Upload your content to Arweave and note the transaction ID:

```bash
# Example: Upload using ArDrive CLI
ardrive upload-file --file-path ./my-website.html

# Note the returned transaction ID
# Example: abc123...def789
```

### Set Environment Variable

Add the transaction ID to your `.env` file:

```bash
APEX_TX_ID=abc123...def789
```

### Restart Gateway

Restart your gateway to apply the configuration:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Update Content

To update your content:

1. Upload new content to Arweave
2. Update `APEX_TX_ID` with the new transaction ID
3. Restart your gateway

**Advantages:**

- Direct control over content
- No additional ArNS setup required
- Simple for one-time content

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires gateway restart for updates
- Less flexible for content management

### Using ArNS Name (Recommended)

### Upload Content

Upload your content to Arweave:

```bash
# Upload your website or dApp
ardrive upload-file --file-path ./my-dapp.html
# Note the transaction ID: xyz789...abc123
```

### Register ArNS Name

Register an ArNS name pointing to your content:

1. Visit [ArNS App](https://arns.app)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Choose your desired name (e.g., `my-gateway-content`)
4. Set the transaction ID: `xyz789...abc123`
5. Pay the registration fee

### Configure Environment Variable

Add the ArNS name to your `.env` file:

```bash
APEX_ARNS_NAME=my-gateway-content
```

### Restart Gateway

Restart your gateway to apply the configuration:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Update Content

To update your content:

1. Upload new content to Arweave
2. Update the ArNS name to point to the new transaction ID
3. **No gateway restart required!**

**Advantages:**

- No restart required for content updates
- Easy content management
- Professional domain naming
- Can be updated independently

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires ArNS setup
- Additional cost for ArNS registration

### Advanced Setup Options

### Custom Content Types

Configure different types of content:

**Static Website:**

```bash
# Upload HTML/CSS/JS files
APEX_ARNS_NAME=my-gateway-website
```

**Single Page Application:**

```bash
# Upload SPA bundle
APEX_ARNS_NAME=my-dapp
```

**Documentation Site:**

```bash
# Upload documentation
APEX_ARNS_NAME=my-gateway-docs
```

### Content Management Workflow

Implement a content management workflow:

1. **Development** - Test content locally
2. **Upload** - Deploy to Arweave
3. **Register** - Create/update ArNS name
4. **Verify** - Check content on gateway
5. **Monitor** - Track performance and usage

## Use Cases and Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Fix Configuration Problems

### Check Environment Variables

Verify your `.env` file configuration:

```bash
# Check if variables are set correctly
grep -E "APEX_(TX_ID|ARNS_NAME)" .env

# Should show only one of:
# APEX_TX_ID=your-transaction-id
# APEX_ARNS_NAME=your-arns-name
```

  Ensure you have only ONE of the APEX variables set, not both.

### Verify Gateway Restart

Ensure your gateway has been restarted after configuration changes:

```bash
# Check if gateway is running
docker compose ps

# Restart if needed
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

### Check Gateway Logs

Review logs for any error messages:

```bash
docker compose logs ar-io-core | grep -i apex
```

### Resolve Content Issues

### Verify Content Accessibility

Test if your content is accessible:

```bash
# Test transaction ID directly
curl -I https://arweave.net/your-transaction-id

# Test ArNS name resolution
curl -I https://your-arns-name.arweave.net
```

### Check Content Format

Ensure your content is properly formatted:

- **HTML content** should have proper DOCTYPE
- **Text content** should be UTF-8 encoded
- **Binary content** should have appropriate Content-Type headers

### Test Content Rendering

Verify content renders correctly in different browsers:

1. Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
2. Check mobile responsiveness
3. Verify all links work correctly
4. Test with different screen sizes

### Fix ArNS Problems

### Verify ArNS Resolution

Check if your ArNS name resolves correctly:

```bash
# Test ArNS resolution
nslookup your-arns-name.arweave.net

# Check if it points to the correct transaction
curl -s https://your-arns-name.arweave.net | head -10
```

### Update ArNS Record

If ArNS name points to wrong content:

1. Go to [ArNS App](https://arns.app)
2. Find your ArNS name
3. Update the transaction ID
4. Wait for propagation (usually immediate)

### Check ArNS Status

Verify ArNS name is active and not expired:

1. Visit the ArNS app
2. Check your name's status
3. Ensure it's not expired
4. Verify payment is up to date

```

## Post-Installation Steps

After successfully setting up automatic SSL renewal:

### Update Gateway Configuration

Configure your AR.IO Gateway to use the new certificates. Update your gateway's SSL configuration to point to:
- **Certificate:** `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem`
- **Private Key:** `/etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem`

### Reload Web Server (Optional)

If you're using nginx or another web server, reload it to apply the new certificates:

```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```

### Monitor Renewal Process

Certbot automatically sets up a systemd timer for renewal. Certificates will be renewed when they have 30 days or less remaining.

To manually check renewal status:

```bash
certbot certificates
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **DNS propagation delays:** Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS changes to propagate
- **API rate limits:** Check your DNS provider's API rate limits
- **Permission errors:** Ensure credential files have correct permissions (600)

### Logs and Debugging

Check certbot logs for detailed error information:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log
```

## General Troubleshooting

### My Gateway Seems to be Running but...

If your release number when you go to `/ar-io/info` is lower than the current release, you simply need to upgrade your gateway in order to reach the latest release.

If your release number includes the suffix "-pre" it means you are running your gateway from the development branch of the github repository, instead of the main branch. The development branch is used for staging work that the engineering team is in the middle of. Because of this, it can be much less stable than the main branch used for production and can cause significant issues.

Ensure that you are running the latest release, from the main branch, by running the below commands in your terminal:

```console
sudo docker compose down --rmi all

git checkout main

git pull

sudo docker compose up -d
```

If this doesn't resolve the issue, you can also try a more extreme method of clearing out the incorrect docker images:

```console
sudo docker compose down

sudo docker system prune -a

sudo docker compose up -d
```

Viewblock and https://gateways.ar.io use a very simple ping method for determining if a gateway is "up". There are plenty of reasons why this ping may fail while the gateway is running perfectly, so showing as down is not cause for concern. Just verify that your gateway is still running, and wait. Your gateway will show as up again soon.

This is normal. Your Observer is working to generate a report and that report will be displayed once it is complete.

This is not an issue with your observer. The short explanation is that your Observer is looking for tasks assigned to it by the AR.IO network contract, but there isnt anything there. You can safely ignore this error message.

When observing a gateway, there are two main pass/fail tests. "Ownership" and "ArNS Assessment"

- Ownership: This tests to see if the value set in your gateway `AR_IO_WALLET` value (in .env) matches the wallet used to join the AR.IO Network. If they don't match, update the value in your .env file and restart your gateway.

- ArNS Assessment: This tests to see if a gateway is able to resolve ArNS names correctly. The first thing you should check is if you have the `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` value set in your .env file. If not, set the value and restart your gateway. If this value is set, check to make sure you have current DNS records and SSL certificates for wildcard subdomains on your gateway.

Once you edit your .env file, you need to "rebuild" your gateway for the changes to take effect. As of release 3, every time you start your gateway with `docker-compose` it is automatically rebuilt. So all you need to do is shut your gateway down and restart it.

The most likely cause of this is inode exhaustion. Test this by running the command:

```
df -i
```

If one of the lines in the output says 100%, you have run out of inodes and so your filesystem is not capable of creating new files, even if you have available space. The solution is to delete files from your `data` folder in order to free up inodes.

This was a common issue prior to release #3, when Redis caching was introduced to reduce the number of small files created. If you are using an older version of the gateway, consider upgrading to mitigate the risk of inode exhaustion.

The first thing you should check if your gateway is not resolving ArNS names is that you have `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` set in your .env file. If not, set it to your domain name used for the gateway. For example, `ARNS_ROOT_HOST=arweave.dev`.

Once this value is set, restart your gateway for the changes to take effect.

If that doesn't resolve the issue, check your dns records. You need to have a wildcard subdomain ( \*. ) set with your domain registrar so that ArNS names will actually point at your gateway. You can set this record, and generate an SSL certificate for it, in the same way you set the records for your primary domain.

This error message means that your SSL certificates have expired. You need to renew your certificates by running the same certbot command you used when you initially started your gateway:

```
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email  -d .com -d '*..com'
```

Certbot SSL certificates expire after 90 days, and you will need to rerun this command to renew every time. If you provide an email address, you will receive an email letting you know when it is time to renew.

If you navigate to your domain and see a 404 error from Nginx (the reverse proxy server used in the setup guide) it means that your domain is correctly pointed at the machine running your gateway, but you have not properly configured your Nginx settings (or your gateway is not running).

The [Set up Networking](./linux-setup.md#set-up-networking) section of the setup guide has detailed instructions on configuring your Nginx server. If all else fails, try restarting Nginx, that usually clears any issues with the server clinging to old configurations.

```
sudo service nginx restart
```

A 502 error from Nginx means that Nginx is working correctly, but it is receiving an error from your gateway when it tries to forward traffic.

When using the manual certbot command provided in the setup guide:

```
sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns --email  -d .com -d '*..com'
```

You need to be sure that you are waiting after creating your TXT records for them to completely propagate. You can check propagation using a tool like [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org).

If you continue to have issues, you can check the [official certbot instructions guide](https://certbot.eff.org/instructions).

- Visit your gateway in a browser and see if your SSL certs are expired. This is the most common issue causing sudden stops in proper operation.

- Try restarting nginx, it sometimes has trouble looking at the new certs without a restart.

- Make sure `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` is properly set in your `.env` file. Updating this requires restarting your gateway.
- Make sure you have a DNS record set for `*.`. Since ArNS names are served as subdomains, you need to make sure all subdomains are pointed at your gateway.
- If your gateway is attempting to resolve the name, but times out, it's most likely a CU issue.

- AR.IO gateways are very robust, they can handle temporary errors gracefully and not affect normal operation. You should only be concerned if the error is consistent or it is causing your gateway to not function properly.

- Observers generate and submit their reports at specific times throughout the epoch. This is to ensure a healthy network throughout the entire epoch, not just at the start.
- Your observer wallet must match the observer wallet associated with your gateway in the AR.IO contract. You can check this by navigating to your gateway in https://gateways.ar.io.

- This happens when a request to a CU fails, and your gateway receives an html failure message instead of the expected JSON response. This will normally clear up on its own after congestion on that CU dies down, but if it is persistent try switching to a different CU.

- This is normal. It means you have reached the current Arweave block and need to wait for more before you can index them.

- This is normal. If a gateway fails to resolve an arns name within 3 seconds, it will fall back to a trusted gateway (arweave.net by default) to help resolve the name.

- There are many reasons a gateway could fail an epoch. Following these steps is usually enough to identify and correct the issue:
  - Try to visit your gateway in a browser and see if your SSL certs are bad
  - Try to resolve an ArNS name on your gateway. If it fails to resolve, check the console and your gateway logs for errors
  - Look at the observation reports that failed your gateway, they will list the reason for failure

## Troubleshooting Failed Epochs

### Overview

The ARIO Network provides several tools to help troubleshoot problems with a gateway. The most powerful among these is the [Observer](/learn/oip).

The Observer, which is a component of every gateway joined to the ARIO Network, checks all gateways in the network to ensure that they are functioning properly, and returning the correct data. The Observer then creates a report of the results of these checks, including the reasons why a gateway might have failed the checks.

If a gateway fails the checks from more than half of the prescribed observers, the gateway is marked as failed for the epoch, and does not receive any rewards for that epoch.

The first step in troubleshooting a failed gateway is always to attempt to resolve data on that gateway in a browser, but if that does not make the issue clear, the Observer report can be used to diagnose the problem.

### Manual Observation

Manual observations may be run on a gateway at any time buy using the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io). This allows operators (or anyone with an interest in the gateway's performance) to check the gateway's performance at any time. To run a manual observation:

1. Navigate to the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io)
2. Select the gateway you are interested in from the list of gateways
3. Click on the "Observe" button in the top right corner of the page.

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/0G52dTWe65abQ6qDGvI99ERAaGU7DHR9srimJXnYRGA)

4. Click on the "Run Observation" button in the bottom right corner of the page.

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/A_B_58rufQ0Pj4ri0AKuC0DJn61u5ayO5ONWpkMerQw)

Two randomly selected ArNS names will be entered automatically in the "ArNS names" field to the left of the "Run Observation" button. These can be changed, or additional ArNS names can be added to the list before running the observation.

The Manual observation will run the same checks as the observer, and will display the results on the right side of the page.

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/vgRXfbx4fa47qGDpjndq128VCHl1wajKaq464KeA0Qg)

### Accessing the Observer Report

The simplest way to access an observer report is via the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io), following the steps below:

1. Navigate to the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io)
2. Select the gateway you are interested in from the list of gateways
3. In the Observation window, select the epoch you are interested in. This will display a list of the observers that failed the gateway for that epoch.
4. Click on the "View Report" button to the right any observer on that list. This will display the entire report that observer generated.

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/ynbxYU_8xLRaU1D6a_LMoUq00roWwsMKgr-xrsDE0Sk)

5. Locate the gateway you are interested in in the report, and click on that row. This will display the report for that gateway.

### Understanding the Observer Report

The observer report will display a list of checked ArNS names, and a reason if the gateway failed to return the correct data for that name. There are several reasons why a gateway might fail to return the correct data for an ArNS name. Below is a list of the most common reasons, and how to resolve them.

#### Timeout awaiting 'socket', or Timeout awaiting 'connect'

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/_GupbMa-EW_wiCD201MuOkDQrLT0MXTfxDXhLSDmyh4)

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/0WkzxdyN-9hJfv0pSiTs0Ozg_wqFvE3-OWlgzYPimtU)

This failure means that the observer was unable to connect to the gateway when it tried to check the ArNS name. There are lots of reasons why this might happen, many of them unrelated to the gateway itself. If an observer report has a small number of these failures, among a larger number of successful checks, it is unlikely to be an issue with the gateway.

If this failure occurs persistently for a large number, or all ArNS names checked, it likely means that the observer is having trouble connecting to the gateway at all. You can verify this by:

- Attempting to connect to the gateway in a browser
- Running manual observations on the gateway using the [Network Portal](https://gateways.ar.io)
- Using tools like `curl` or `ping` to check the gateway's connectivity

If these methods consistently fail to connect to the gateway, it is likely that the gateway is not properly configured or powered on. If this is the case:

- Check Docker and the gateway's logs to see if the gateway is on.
- Ensure that the SSL certificates are valid for the gateway's domain.
- Check DNS records for the gateway's domain, misconfigured or conflicting DNS records can cause connectivity issues.

Some gateway operators who run their gateways on their personal home networks have also reported issues with their ISP blocking, throttling, or otherwise delaying traffic to a gateway. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, it may be worth checking with your ISP to see if they are blocking or throttling traffic to the gateway.

Using [Grafana](/build/extensions/grafana) can also provide a visual representation of the gateway's ArNS resolution times. If this is consistently high (above 10 seconds), it is likely that the gateway is not properly configured to resolve ArNS names. Ensure that the gateway is operating on the latest Release.

#### Cert has expired

This failure means that the gateway's SSL certificate has expired. Obtaining a new SSL certificate and updating the gateway's reverse proxy (nginx, etc) configuration to use the new certificate is the only solution to this issue.

#### dataHashDigest mismatch

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/xXe0bHne--0JJv-HRf5HT9R1V1UbzaOh2AxvAdQZhjg)

This failure means that the gateway did respond to a resolution request, but the data it returned did not match the data that was expected. This could be due to a number of reasons, including:

- Cached data was returned by the gateway that doesnt match the most current data on the network.
- The gateway is configured to operate on testnet or devnet. Gateways joined to the ARIO Network MUST operate on mainnet in order to pass observation checks.
- The gateway is intentionally returning fraudulent data.

A gateway will not return fraudulent data unless that operator intentionally rewrote the gateway's code to do so, and a major purpose of the Observation and Incentive Protocol is to catch and prevent this behavior. A gateway may return mistaken data on occasion, usually due to a cache mismatch between the gateway and the observer's authority (usually arweavae.net). This is a relatively rare occurrence, and should only be considered an issue if it occurs persistently. If most or all of the ArNS names checked are failing for this reason, it is likely that the gateway is not operating on mainnet.

#### Response code 502 (Bad Gateway)

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/NBQsYUKP6IZt_rYg77QXgzwUUPvimFGXCQqtesbW1_I)

This failure means that the observer was able to connect to the gateway's network, but the reverse proxy returned a 502 error. This is almost always a reverse proxy issue. Ensure that the gateway's reverse proxy is running, and that it is configured to forward requests to the gateway.

Testing the validity of the reverse proxy's configuration file (`sudo nginx -t` on Nginx) may provide more information about the issue, and restarting the reverse proxy (`sudo nginx -s reload`) often resolves the issue if there are no problems with the configuration file.

It is also possible that the gateway itself is not running at all. Check Docker and the gateway's logs to see if the gateway is on.

#### Response code 503 (Service Unavailable)

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/7eFKSm-cs81-aJ_H4xkolR2nSlxl5tYWXJdFTei8Dbs)

This failure means that the observer was able to connect to the gateway's network, but the reverse proxy was unable to forward the request to the gateway. It differs from the 502 error in that the reverse proxy is likely able to see that the gateway is running, but is unable to communicate with it. This is often a temporary issue, caused by the gateway not being able to handle a heavy load of requests, or the gateway being in the process of restarting. If this failure occurs once or twice in a report, it is likely a temporary issue and should not be considered an issue with the gateway. However, when this failure occurs persistently, particularly for every ArNS name checked on the report, it is likely that the gateway may have crashed.

Manually restarting the gateway can likely resolve the issue.

#### connect EHOSTUNREACH

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/O-uG-yGm5bNxjw2ADH_yBjOcGo-ZEiFym8GeFZZNueY)

This failure means that the observer was unable to connect to the gateway at all. The connection was either refused, or the gateway was not able to find a target based on the domain name's DNS records.

This is almost always an issue with DNS records or local network configuration. Ensure that the gateway domain has correct DNS records, and that the local network is set up to allow connections. Checking logs from the local network's reverse proxy (nginx, etc) may provide more information about the issue.

#### getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/WJDwW0NM29uKC-9puvhXK_n75vgFXLpa6VKFVMhRsLQ)

This is another DNS related issue. Likely, the gateway does not have a valid DNS record either for the top level domain or the required wildcard subdomain. Having this failure occur once or twice in a report could mean that the DNS server being used by the observer is having temporary issues and should not be considered an issue with the gateway. However, when this failure occurs persistently, particularly for every ArNS name checked on the report, it is likely that the gateway's DNS records are not set, or are misconfigured.

#### Hostname/IP does not match certificate's altnames: Host: \. is not in the cert's altnames: DNS:\

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/HfOfpAYm811dWFPNQC7bANEvjGVK4ch3kO7K7qMN9qs)

This failure means that the observer's SSL certificate does not match the gateway's domain name. This is almost always an issue with the gateway's SSL certificate. This most likely occurred because the gateway's operator did not update the gateway's SSL certificate when the gateway's domain name was changed. Obtaining a new SSL certificate and updating the gateway's reverse proxy configuration to use the new certificate is the only solution to this issue.

#### write EPROTO \:error:\:SSL routines:ssl3_read_bytes:tlsv1 unrecognized name:\:SSL alert number 112

![Diagram](https://arweave.net/Hbip_ZmqmFN8-uXijw1aylyYp1YllwgyZTNAcsPCxSg)

This failure almost always means that the gateway operator did not properly obtain SSL certificates for the gateway's wildcard subdomain. Obtaining a new SSL certificate and updating the gateway's reverse proxy configuration to use the new certificate is the only solution to this issue.

## FAQ

- Gateway protocol rewards are calculated as 0.1% of the protocol balance (0.05% after August 2025) split between all gateways in the network. A change in the protocol balance or the number of gateways in the network between epochs will result in the reward for an individual gateway changing.

- The Observer rewards are separate from protocol rewards, and if your gateway is selected as an observer for an epoch, assuming it performs its duties well, it will receive additional rewards

The observer selection process uses a weighted random selection method that considers multiple factors beyond just stake:

- **Stake Weight (SW)**: Ratio of your total staked ARIO tokens (including delegated stake) to the network minimum
- **Tenure Weight (TW)**: How long your gateway has been part of the network (capped at 4 after 2 years)
- **Gateway Performance Ratio Weight (GPRW)**: Ratio of epochs where you correctly resolved names vs total participation
- **Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)**: Ratio of epochs where you successfully submitted reports vs total observer periods

A composite weight (CW) is calculated as: CW = SW × TW × GPRW × OPRW

Up to 50 gateways are chosen as observers per epoch. If there are more than 50 gateways, selection is randomized based on these normalized weights. Even with a high stake, other factors like performance and tenure affect your chances of being selected.

- There is a 90 day locking period when withdrawing stake, either from delegated stake or operator stake on your gateway. This locking period can be skipped, for a fee. The fee starts at 50% of the withdrawal amount, and goes down over time. If you selected instant withdrawal, you paid the fee to skip the locking period.

- The minimum operator stake for gateways (10,000 ARIO) cannot be instantly withdrawn, it is subject to the full 90 day locking period, and withdrawal can only be started by removing your gateway from the network.

- If possible, leave your original server running while you prepare the new one
- Set up the new server following the same steps you used to set up the original server
  - This includes setting up SSL certificates for the new server
- You must use the same gateway wallet when setting up the new server
- The observer wallet may be changed at any point, but requires extra steps. It is recommended you use the original observer wallet as well
- Once the new server is set up, change your DNS A records to point at the new server
- After your DNS records are set and you have verified your gateway is operating correctly, shut down the original server
- No changes need to be made in the network contract or on https://gateways.ar.io

- Yes
- Configure your new domain to point at your gateway, including setting up SSL certificates
- Update your NGINX (or other reverse proxy) server to recognize the new domain. This usually requires a restart of NGINX
- Update the `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` variable in your `.env` and restart the gateway
- Using https://gateways.ar.io, update your gateway settings to change the FQDN in the contract
- Your gateway is now using the new domain name for normal operation.

# Upgrading your Gateway (/build/run-a-gateway/manage/upgrading-a-gateway)

To ensure the optimal performance and security of your AR.IO Gateway, it's essential to regularly upgrade to the latest version. Notably, indexed data resides separate from Docker. As a result, neither upgrading the Gateway nor pruning Docker will erase your data or progress. Here's how you can perform the upgrade:

## Prerequisites

- Your Gateway should have been cloned using git. If you haven't, follow the [installation instructions](/build/run-a-gateway/join-the-network).

## Checking your Release Number

Effective with release 3, you can view the currently implemented release on any gateway by visiting `https:///ar-io/info` in a browser. Be sure to replace `` with the domain of the gateway you are checking.

If the release number displayed includes `-pre` it means that your gateway is using the `develop` branch of the github repo for the gateway code. Follow steps in our [troubleshooting guide](/build/run-a-gateway/manage/troubleshooting) to switch over to the more stable `main` branch.

Announcements will be made in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/cuCqBb5v) showing each new release.

## Quick Start

### Pull Latest Changes

Navigate to your cloned repository directory and execute:

```bash
git pull
```

### Shut Down Docker

Stop your gateway:

```bash
sudo docker compose down -v
```

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Restart Gateway

Start your gateway with the new version:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

  Effective with Release #3, it is no longer required to include the `--build`
  flag when starting your gateway. Docker will automatically build using the
  image specified in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

## Detailed Upgrade Process

### Full Upgrade Process

### Pull Latest Changes

Navigate to your cloned repository directory and execute:

```bash
git pull
```

### Shut Down Docker

Stop your gateway:

```bash
sudo docker compose down -v
```

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Check for New Environment Variables

Read the update release change logs and community announcements to see if the new version includes any new environmental variables that you should set before restarting your gateway.

### Restart the Gateway

Start your gateway with the new version:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

  Effective with Release #3, it is no longer required to include the `--build`
  flag when starting your gateway. Docker will automatically build using the
  image specified in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Docker Pruning (Optional)

It's a good practice to clean up unused Docker resources after shutting down your gateway.

  This will erase all inactive docker containers on your machine. If you use
  docker for anything beyond running a gateway be extremely careful using this
  command.

### Shut Down Gateway

First, stop your gateway:

```bash
sudo docker compose down -v
```

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

### Prune Docker System

Clean up unused Docker resources:

```bash
sudo docker system prune
```

```bash
docker system prune
```

### Restart Gateway

Start your gateway:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Checking for New Environment Variables

New gateway releases may introduce new environment variables that you need to configure.

### Review Release Notes

Check the release notes and community announcements for any new environment variables:

- Review the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-node/releases)
- Check the [AR.IO Discord](https://discord.gg/7zUPfN4D6g) for announcements
- Look for changes in the `.env.example` file

### Update Your .env File

Add any new environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Example: Add new environment variables
NEW_FEATURE_ENABLED=true
NEW_CONFIG_VALUE=default_value
```

### Restart Gateway

Restart your gateway to apply the new environment variables:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

That's it! Your AR.IO Gateway is now upgraded to the latest version. Ensure to test and verify that everything is functioning as expected. If you encounter any issues, reach out to the [AR.IO community](https://discord.gg/7zUPfN4D6g) for assistance.

        - 2 TB SSD storage
        - Stable 1 Gbps internet connection

        External storage devices should be formatted as ext4.

        ### Install Required Packages

        **Quick install all packages:**
        ```bash
        sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install -y curl openssh-server git certbot nginx sqlite3 build-essential && sudo systemctl enable ssh && curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash && source ~/.bashrc && sudo ufw allow 22 80 443 && sudo ufw enable
        ```

        **Install Docker:**
        ```bash
        # Add Docker's official GPG key
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
        sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
        sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
        sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

        # Add the repository to Apt sources
        echo \
          "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
          $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
          sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
        sudo apt-get update

        # Install Docker
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
        ```

        **Install Node.js and Yarn:**
        ```bash
        nvm install 20.11.1 && nvm use 20.11.1 && npm install -g yarn@1.22.22
        ```

        ### Install the Node

        **Clone the repository:**
        ```bash
        git clone -b main https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-node
        cd ar-io-node
        ```

        **Note:** Your indexing databases will be created in the project directory unless otherwise specified in your .env file, not your Docker environment. So, if you are using an external hard drive, you should install the node directly to that external drive.

        **Create environment file:**
        ```bash
        nano .env
        ```

        **Add configuration:**
        ```bash
        GRAPHQL_HOST=arweave.net
        GRAPHQL_PORT=443
        START_HEIGHT=1000000
        RUN_OBSERVER=true
        ARNS_ROOT_HOST=
        AR_IO_WALLET=
        OBSERVER_WALLET=
        ```

        **Supply Observer Wallet Keyfile:**
        Save your wallet keyfile as `.json` in the `wallets` directory.

          By default, the Observer will use [Turbo Credits](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/turbo/credits) to pay for uploading reports to Arweave. This allows reports under 100kb to be uploaded for free, but larger reports will fail if the Observer wallet does not contain Credits. Including `REPORT_DATA_SINK=arweave` in your `.env` file will configure the Observer to use AR tokens instead of Turbo Credits, without any free limit.

        **Start the Docker container:**
        ```bash
        sudo docker compose up -d
        ```

        ### Set Up Networking

        **Register a Domain Name:**
        Choose a domain registrar (e.g., [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com)) to register a domain name.

        **Point Domain at Your Home Network:**
        - Get your public IP address: `curl ifconfig.me`
        - Create A records for your domain and wildcard subdomains (`*.yourdomain.com`)

        **Set up Port Forwarding:**
        - Get local IP: `ip addr show | grep -w inet | awk '{print $2}' | awk -F'/' '{print $1}'`
        - Configure router to forward ports 80 and 443 to your local machine

        **Create SSL Certificates:**
        ```bash
        sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d .com -d '*..com'
        ```

          Previous versions of these instructions advised providing an email address to Certbot. As of June 2025, LetsEncrypt (the certificate authority used by Certbot) no longer supports email notifications.

        **Important:** Wild card subdomain (*.&lt;your-domain&gt;.com) cannot auto renew without obtaining an API key from your domain registrar. Not all registrars offer this. Certbot certificates expire every 90 days. Be sure to consult with your chosen registrar to see if they offer an API for this purpose, or run the above command again to renew your certificates.

        ### Configure nginx

        **Open nginx configuration:**
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
        ```

        **Replace with this configuration:**
        ```nginx
        # Force redirects from HTTP to HTTPS
        server {
            listen 80;
            listen [::]:80;
            server_name .com *..com;

            location / {
                return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
            }
        }

        # Forward traffic to your node and provide SSL certificates
        server {
            listen 443 ssl;
            listen [::]:443 ssl;
            server_name .com *..com;

            ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/.com/fullchain.pem;
            ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/.com/privkey.pem;

            location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;

                # Forward AR.IO headers if present in the request
                proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin $http_x_ar_io_origin;
                proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin-Node-Release $http_x_ar_io_origin_node_release;
                proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Hops $http_x_ar_io_hops;
            }
        }
        ```

        **Test and restart nginx:**
        ```bash
        sudo nginx -t
        sudo service nginx restart
        ```

        **Note:** Previous versions of these instructions advised checking a gateway's ability to fetch content using `localhost`. Subsequent security updates prevent this without first unsetting `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` in your `.env`.

        ### Test Your Gateway

        **Verify it's working:**
        ```bash
        curl https:///3lyxgbgEvqNSvJrTX2J7CfRychUD5KClFhhVLyTPNCQ
        ```

        **Expected output:**
        ```
        1984
        ```

        If you see `1984`, your gateway is working perfectly!

        ### System Requirements

        **Minimum requirements:**
        - 4 core CPU
        - 4 GB RAM
        - 500 GB storage (SSD recommended)
        - Stable 50 Mbps internet connection

        **Recommended:**
        - 12 core CPU
        - 32 GB RAM
        - 2 TB SSD storage
        - Stable 1 Gbps internet connection

        External storage devices should be formatted as ext4.

        ### Install Required Software

        **Install Docker Desktop:**
        - Download from [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
        - Run installer and follow prompts
        - Select WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) during installation
        - Restart your PC
        - Update WSL:
          ```cmd
          wsl --update
          wsl --shutdown
          ```
        - Restart Docker Desktop

        **Install Git:**
        - Download from [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
        - Run installer with default settings

        ### Clone the Repository

        **Open Command Prompt:**
        - Press `Windows Key + R`
        - Type `cmd` and press `Enter`

        **Navigate to desired directory:**
        ```cmd
        cd Documents
        ```

        **Clone the repository:**
        ```cmd
        git clone -b main https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-node
        ```

        **Note:** Your database will be created in the project directory, not Docker. If using an external hard drive, install directly to that drive.

        ### Create Environment File

        **Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad):**
        - Press `Windows Key` and search for "Notepad"

        **Create .env file with this content:**
        ```bash
        GRAPHQL_HOST=arweave.net
        GRAPHQL_PORT=443
        START_HEIGHT=0
        RUN_OBSERVER=true
        ARNS_ROOT_HOST=
        AR_IO_WALLET=
        OBSERVER_WALLET=
        ```

        **Save as `.env`** (select "All Files" as file type)

        **Supply Observer Wallet Keyfile:**
        Save your wallet keyfile as `.json` in the `wallets` directory.

        ### Start Docker Containers

        **Navigate to project directory:**
        ```cmd
        cd Documents\ar-io-node
        ```

        **Start the container:**
        ```cmd
        docker compose up -d
        ```

        **Explanation of flags:**
        - `up`: Start the Docker containers
        - `-d`: Run containers as background processes (detached mode)

        **Shutdown command:**
        ```cmd
        docker compose down
        ```

        ### Set Up Router Port Forwarding

        **Obtain a Domain Name:**
        Choose a domain registrar (e.g., [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com)) and purchase a domain name.

        **Point Domain at Your Home Network:**
        - Visit https://www.whatsmyip.org/ to get your public IP address
        - Access your domain registrar's settings
        - Create A records for your domain and wildcard subdomains (`*.yourdomain.com`)

        **Get Local IP Address:**
        ```cmd
        ipconfig
        ```
        Look for IPv4 Address (format: `192.168.X.X` or `10.X.X.X`)

        **Set Up Router Port Forwarding:**
        - Access router settings (usually `192.168.0.1`)
        - Navigate to port forwarding settings
        - Forward ports 80 and 443 to your local machine's IP address

        ### Install and Configure NGINX Docker

        **Clone NGINX Docker repository:**
        ```cmd
        cd Documents
        git clone -b main https://github.com/bobinstein/dockerized-nginx
        ```

        **Follow the repository instructions** for setting up NGINX Docker.

        **Important:** When configuring your nginx setup, ensure that your nginx configuration includes the following AR.IO headers in the proxy configuration:

        ```nginx
        # Forward AR.IO headers if present in the request
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin $http_x_ar_io_origin;
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin-Node-Release $http_x_ar_io_origin_node_release;
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Hops $http_x_ar_io_hops;
        ```

        These headers are essential for proper AR.IO network functionality.

        ### Test Your Gateway

        **Verify it's working:**
        Visit `https:///3lyxgbgEvqNSvJrTX2J7CfRychUD5KClFhhVLyTPNCQ` in your browser.

        **Expected output:**
        ```
        1984
        ```

        If you see `1984`, your gateway is working perfectly!

## Useful Docker Commands

    ```

    ### Authenticate with Your Wallet

    Choose your preferred authentication method:

            ```typescript
                        
            // Load your Arweave JWK file
            const jwk = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('wallet.json', 'utf-8'))
            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              privateKey: jwk, // ArweaveJWK type
              token: 'arweave', // Default token type
            })
            ```

            ```typescript
            
            // Your Ethereum private key (with 0x prefix)
            const privateKey = '0x1234...' // EthPrivateKey type

            // Create an Ethereum signer instance
            const signer = new EthereumSigner(privateKey)
            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              signer,
              token: 'ethereum',
            })
            ```

            ```typescript
                        
            // Your Solana secret key (as Uint8Array)
            const secretKey = new Uint8Array([...]) // SolSecretKey type

            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              privateKey: bs58.encode(secretKey),

    ### Purchase Turbo Credits

    [Turbo Credits](/build/upload/turbo-credits) are the payment medium used by the Turbo Upload Service. Each Credit represents a 1:1 conversion from the upload power of the Arweave native token (AR).

        - **Fiat Currency**: Credit/debit cards via the [Turbo Top Up App](https://turbo-topup.com/)
        - **Cryptocurrencies**: AR, ETH, SOL, MATIC, ARIO, USDC, KYVE, ETH (BASE)
        - **Multiple Wallets**: Ethereum, Solana, and Arweave wallets supported

            ```typescript
            
            // Initialize authenticated client
            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              privateKey: jwk
            })

            // Top up with AR tokens
            const topUpResult = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
              tokenAmount: WinstonToTokenAmount(100_000_000), // 0.0001 AR
            })
            ```

            ```typescript
            
            // Initialize authenticated client
            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              signer: new EthereumSigner(privateKey),
              token: 'ethereum',
            })

            // Top up with ETH tokens
            const topUpResult = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
              tokenAmount: 0.001, // 0.001 ETH
            })
            ```

            ```typescript
            
            // Initialize authenticated client
            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              privateKey: bs58.encode(secretKey),
              token: 'solana'
            })

            // Top up with SOL tokens
            const topUpResult = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
              tokenAmount: 0.1, // 0.1 SOL
            })
            ```

            ```typescript
            
            // Initialize authenticated client
            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              signer: new EthereumSigner(privateKey),
              token: 'matic',
            })

            // Top up with MATIC tokens
            const topUpResult = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
              tokenAmount: 1.0, // 1.0 MATIC
            })
            ```

            ```typescript
            
            // Initialize authenticated client
            const turbo = await TurboFactory.authenticated({
              privateKey,
              token: 'kyve',
            })

            // Top up with KYVE tokens
            const topUpResult = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
              tokenAmount: 100, // 100 KYVE
            })
            ```

# Getting Started with Turbo (/build/upload/bundling-services)

Upload data to Arweave using **Turbo** - the most reliable way to upload data to Arweave. Turbo provides enterprise-grade infrastructure with flexible payment options and optimized performance.

## What is Turbo?

Turbo is a ultrahigh-throughput Permaweb service that streamlines the funding, indexing, and transmission of data to and from Arweave. It provides graphical and programmatic interfaces for payment options in fiat currency with credit or debit cards as well as cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, USDC, and AR. It integrates two key components: a service that bundles uploads for efficiency and ease, and a payment system designed for straightforward transactions. Turbo Credits, which users can purchase within the ArDrive web app, the [Turbo Top Up App](https://turbo-topup.com/), or by using the [Turbo SDK/CLI](/sdks/turbo-sdk), have the same storage purchasing power of AR tokens, along with the additional benefits provided by Turbo. These credits are meticulously calibrated, with the Winston Credit (winc) representing the smallest unit, ensuring users have precise control over their storage needs. As an open-source technology, Turbo encourages community engagement, allowing developers to contribute to its continuous enhancement.

## Get Started

### Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
```

### Set Up Your Wallet

Create a new wallet or use an existing one:

```bash
# Create a new wallet (easy way)
npx permaweb/wallet > key.json
```

Then load it in your code:

```js

// Load your wallet
const jwk = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./key.json", "utf-8"));
const signer = new ArweaveSigner(jwk);

// Initialize Turbo
const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer });
```

### Get Turbo Credits

Purchase Turbo Credits to pay for uploads. When you upload, credits are automatically used and Turbo handles the payment to Arweave.

**Option 1: Via the Web Interface**

- Go to [turbo-topup.com](https://turbo-topup.com)
- Pay with fiat currencies (credit cards) or crypto tokens (ARIO, USDC, SOL, MATIC, AR)

**Option 2: Via the SDK**

```js
// Purchase credits programmatically
const fundResult = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
  tokenAmount: TOKEN_AMOUNT,
  tokenType: "solana", // or 'ethereum', 'matic', 'arweave'
});
```

**Check Your Balance**

```js
const balance = await turbo.getBalance();
console.log(`Balance: ${balance.winc} Winston Credits`);
```

### Upload Your Data

```js tab="Upload File"
const fileData = fs.readFileSync("./myfile.jpg");

const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: fileData,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "image/jpeg" },
      { name: "Title", value: "My Image" },
    ],
  },
});

console.log("Upload ID:", result.id);
console.log("Owner:", result.owner);

````

```js tab="Upload Folder"

    tags: [
      { name: "Bundle-Format", value: "binary" },
      { name: "Bundle-Version", value: "2.0.0" },
    ],
  },
});

console.log("Folder Upload ID:", folderResult.id);
console.log("Manifest ID:", folderResult.manifestId);
````

```js tab="Upload Raw Data"
const data = JSON.stringify({
  message: "Hello Arweave!",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});

const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: data,
  dataItemOpts: {

# Encryption (/build/upload/encryption)

**Arweave has no built-in encryption.** All encryption and decryption must be handled client-side before uploading data to the network. Arweave is completely data-agnostic - it stores whatever data you provide without any knowledge of whether it's encrypted or not.

## How Encryption Works on Arweave

**Critical Points:**

- **No native encryption**: Arweave provides no encryption services whatsoever
- **Client-side only**: You must encrypt data before uploading
- **Data-agnostic storage**: Arweave stores any data type, including encrypted data
- **Your responsibility**: You handle all encryption, key management, and decryption
- **Permanent security**: Once encrypted and stored, data remains secure forever

## Encryption Options

### 1. Manual Client-Side Encryption

Encrypt your data before uploading with Turbo:

```js

// Encrypt sensitive data
const data = "Sensitive information";
const secretKey = "your-secret-key";
const encryptedData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, secretKey).toString();

// Upload encrypted data
const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: encryptedData,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/octet-stream" },
      { name: "Encrypted", value: "true" },
      { name: "Cipher", value: "AES-256-GCM" },
      { name: "Cipher-IV", value: "YWJjZGVmZ2hpams=" }, // 12 byte initialization vector as Base64
    ],
  },
});
```

## Encryption Standards

### Encryption Methods

- **AES-256-GCM**: Authenticated encryption (recommended)
- **AES-256-CTR**: Stream cipher for large files
- **Any encryption method**: Arweave supports any encryption you choose (must be indicated in `Cipher` tag for ArFS compliance)

### Required Tags

When uploading encrypted data, include these tags:

```js
{
  name: "Content-Type",
  value: "application/octet-stream"  // Required for encrypted data
},
{
  name: "Cipher",
  value: "AES-256-GCM"  // Specify encryption method
},
{
  name: "Cipher-IV",
  value: "base64-encoded-iv"  // Initialization vector
}
```

## ArFS Protocol (Optional Standardization)

The [Arweave File System (ArFS)](/build/advanced/arfs) protocol provides optional standardization for encrypted storage:

- **Private Drives**: Encrypt entire file systems
- **File-level encryption**: Each file has its own encryption key
- **Selective sharing**: Share individual files without exposing the entire drive
- **Key derivation**: Uses HKDF-SHA256 with wallet signatures
- **Completely optional**: You can use any encryption method you prefer

  **ArDrive Web App:** Data uploaded through the ArDrive web app to Private
  Drives is encrypted for you using the standards set in the ArFS protocol.
  ArDrive is simply a web application that implements ArFS - there is no
  separate "ArDrive Encryption Service."

  **ArFS Privacy:** To learn more about ArFS encryption schema, key derivation,
  and private drive management, see our detailed [ArFS Privacy & Encryption
  documentation](/build/advanced/arfs/privacy).

## Getting Started

    For most users, the ArDrive web app provides the easiest way to encrypt and store data using ArFS standards:

        **Create a private drive** in the ArDrive web app

        **Set a strong password** for your drive

        **Upload files** - they're automatically encrypted using ArFS

        **Access files** using your password and wallet

    For developers who need custom encryption:

        **Choose an encryption library** (Crypto-JS, Web Crypto API)

        **Encrypt your data** before uploading

        **Add proper tags** to indicate encryption

        **Store keys securely** for decryption

## Security Considerations

  **Important:** Never store encryption keys in your code or public
  repositories. Use secure key management practices and consider hardware
  security modules for production applications.

**Best Practices:**

- Use strong, randomly generated keys
- Implement proper key rotation
- Store keys securely (not in code)
- Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM)
- Validate data integrity after decryption

```

## Organize Your Data

Before uploading, learn best practices for structuring and tagging your data for optimal retrieval and organization.

## Additional Resources

# Manifests (/build/upload/manifests)

Manifests enable friendly-path-name routing for data on Arweave, greatly improving the programmability of data relationships. Instead of accessing data with complex transaction IDs, manifests allow you to organize files with readable paths and relative links.

## What are Manifests?

Manifests, also known as "Path Manifests" or "Arweave Manifests," are JSON objects that connect various Arweave data items and define relational paths for easy navigation. A common use case is permanently hosting websites on Arweave by linking all necessary files together.

### The Problem Manifests Solve

Without manifests, accessing data on Arweave looks like this:

```
http:///cG7Hdi_iTQPoEYgQJFqJ8NMpN4KoZ-vH_j7pG4iP7NI (txID of a website's index.html)
http:///3zFsd7bkCAUtXUKBQ4XiPiQvpLVKfZ6kiLNt2XVSfoV (txID of its js/style.css)
http:///or0_fRYFcQYWh-QsozygI5Zoamw_fUsYu2w8_X1RkYZ (txID of its assets/img/logo.png)
```

With manifests, the same data becomes:

```
http:/// (resolves to the txID of index.html)
http:////js/style.css
http:////assets/img/logo.png
```

## Manifest Structure

Manifests are JSON objects that define how data items are connected and accessed through friendly paths.

### Sample Manifest

```json
{
  "manifest": "arweave/paths",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "index": {
    "path": "index.html"
  },
  "fallback": {
    "id": "iXo3LSfVKVtXUKBzfZ4d7bkCAp6kiLNt2XVUFsPiQvQ"
  },
  "paths": {
    "index.html": {
      "id": "cG7Hdi_iTQPoEYgQJFqJ8NMpN4KoZ-vH_j7pG4iP7NI"
    },
    "404.html": {
      "id": "iXo3LSfVKVtXUKBzfZ4d7bkCAp6kiLNt2XVUFsPiQvQ"
    },
    "js/style.css": {
      "id": "3zFsd7bkCAUtXUKBQ4XiPiQvpLVKfZ6kiLNt2XVSfoV"
    },
    "css/style.css": {
      "id": "sPiQvpAUXLVK3zF6iXSfo7bkCVQkiLNt24dVtXUKBfZ"
    },
    "css/mobile.css": {
      "id": "fZ4d7bkCAUiXSfo3zFsPiQvpLVKVtXUKB6kiLNt2XVQ"
    },
    "assets/img/logo.png": {
      "id": "or0_fRYFcQYWh-QsozygI5Zoamw_fUsYu2w8_X1RkYZ"
    },
    "assets/img/icon.png": {
      "id": "0543SMRGYuGKTaqLzmpOyK4AxAB96Fra2guHzYxjRGo"
    }
  }
}
```

### How it Works

A resolver, typically an AR.IO gateway, resolves URLs requesting content based on a manifest transaction ID to the corresponding path key in the `paths` object. The URL schema for this type of request is `https:////`.

### Example Usage

Assume the manifest above is uploaded to Arweave with the transaction ID `UyC5P5qKPZaltMmmZAWdakhlDXsBF6qmyrbWYFchRTk`. The below table shows https requests to the AR.IO gateway `arweave.net`:

| Request Path                                                                 | Manifest Path | Data served from txID                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| https://arweave.net/UyC5P5qKPZaltMmmZAWdakhlDXsBF6qmyrbWYFchRTk              | index         | cG7Hdi_iTQPoEYgQJFqJ8NMpN4KoZ-vH_j7pG4iP7NI |
| https://arweave.net/UyC5P5qKPZaltMmmZAWdakhlDXsBF6qmyrbWYFchRTk/index.html   | index.html    | cG7Hdi_iTQPoEYgQJFqJ8NMpN4KoZ-vH_j7pG4iP7NI |
| https://arweave.net/UyC5P5qKPZaltMmmZAWdakhlDXsBF6qmyrbWYFchRTk/js/style.css | js/style.css  | 3zFsd7bkCAUtXUKBQ4XiPiQvpLVKfZ6kiLNt2XVSfoV |
| https://arweave.net/UyC5P5qKPZaltMmmZAWdakhlDXsBF6qmyrbWYFchRTk/foobar       | fallback      | iXo3LSfVKVtXUKBzfZ4d7bkCAp6kiLNt2XVUFsPiQvQ |

## Creating Manifests with Turbo

Turbo makes it easy to create manifests automatically when uploading folders, or you can create custom manifests manually.

### Folder Upload with Manifest

```js
const folderResult = await turbo.uploadFolder({
  folderPath: "./my-website",
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Bundle-Format", value: "binary" },
      { name: "Bundle-Version", value: "2.0.0" },
      { name: "App-Name", value: "Website" },
    ],
  },
});

console.log("Folder Upload ID:", folderResult.id);
console.log("Manifest ID:", folderResult.manifestId);
```

### Custom Manifest Creation

```js
const manifest = {
  manifest: "arweave/paths",
  version: "0.2.0",
  index: {
    path: "index.html",
  },
  fallback: {
    id: "fallback-tx-id",
  },
  paths: {
    "index.html": {
      id: "abc123...def789",
    },
    "css/style.css": {
      id: "def456...ghi012",
    },
  },
};

const manifestResult = await turbo.upload({
  data: JSON.stringify(manifest),
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/x.arweave-manifest+json" },
      { name: "App-Name", value: "CustomManifest" },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Manifest Specifications

### Required Transaction Tags

Manifests must be uploaded with specific tags so that AR.IO gateways can recognize and properly resolve them:

```json
{ "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/x.arweave-manifest+json" }
```

  **Important:** This tag must be attached to the upload transaction, NOT placed
  inside the JSON object. Failure to provide this tag will result in resolvers
  not recognizing the manifest.

### Required JSON Attributes

#### manifest

```json
"manifest": "arweave/paths"
```

Must have the value `arweave/paths` for gateways to resolve the manifest.

#### version

```json
"version": "0.2.0"
```

Defines the version of manifest schema being used.

#### index

```json
"index": {
  "path": "index.html"
}
```

or

```json
"index": {
  "id": "cG7Hdi_iTQPoEYgQJFqJ8NMpN4KoZ-vH_j7pG4iP7NI"
}
```

Defines the base or 'starting' data item. Accepts either `path` (key in paths object) or `id` (specific transaction ID). If both are defined, `id` overrides `path`.

#### fallback

```json
"fallback": {
  "id": "iXo3LSfVKVtXUKBzfZ4d7bkCAp6kiLNt2XVUFsPiQvQ"
}
```

Defines a fallback data item for when requested paths don't exist (like a 404 page).

#### paths

```json
"paths": {
  "index.html": {
    "id": "cG7Hdi_iTQPoEYgQJFqJ8NMpN4KoZ-vH_j7pG4iP7NI"
  },
  "css/style.css": {
    "id": "3zFsd7bkCAUtXUKBQ4XiPiQvpLVKfZ6kiLNt2XVSfoV"
  }
}
```

Defines the URL paths that a manifest can resolve to. Each path maps to a specific Arweave transaction ID.

## Relative Path Routing

AR.IO gateways support relative path routing, making it easy to develop and maintain websites hosted on Arweave. Instead of using fully qualified URLs:

```html

```

You can use relative paths:

```html

```

This makes HTML more readable and ensures links remain valid even if the hosting domain changes.

## Best Practices

### File Organization

- Use descriptive file paths
- Organize files in logical folders
- Keep manifest files small
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Performance Considerations

- Minimize manifest size
- Use relative paths
- Avoid deep nesting
- Consider file size limits

# Tagging (/build/upload/tagging)

Tags are key-value pairs that provide metadata about your uploaded data on Arweave. They enable discoverability, proper content serving, and integration with various protocols.

## Essential Tags

Every upload should include these tags:

- **Content-Type**: Required - tells gateways how to serve your data
- **App-Name**: Best practice - identifies your application for discoverability

```js
const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: fileData,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "image/jpeg" },
      { name: "App-Name", value: "MyApp-v1.0" },
      { name: "Title", value: "My Image" },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Common Tag Types

### Content Types

- `image/jpeg`, `image/png` - Images
- `application/json` - JSON data
- `text/html` - HTML pages
- `video/mp4` - Videos
- `application/pdf` - Documents

### App-Specific Tags

- `App-Name` - Your application identifier (e.g., "MyApp-v1.0", "PhotoGallery-2024")
- `Title` - Human-readable title
- `Description` - Content description
- `Author` - Content creator
- `Version` - Application version

### Protocol Tags

- `License` - Universal Data License (UDL) transaction ID
- `License-Fee` - Fee for UDL licensing

  **UDL Integration:** Learn about the [Universal Data
  License](https://mirror.xyz/0x64eA438bd2784F2C52a9095Ec0F6158f847182d9/AjNBmiD4A4Sw-ouV9YtCO6RCq0uXXcGwVJMB5cdfbhE)
  for monetizing your data.

## Advanced Tagging

### Folder Uploads

```js
const folderResult = await turbo.uploadFolder({
  folderPath: "./my-website",
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Bundle-Format", value: "binary" },
      { name: "Bundle-Version", value: "2.0.0" },
      { name: "App-Name", value: "MyWebsite-v2.1" },
      { name: "Version", value: "2.1.0" },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Licensed Content

```js
const licensedTags = [
  { name: "Content-Type", value: "image/jpeg" },
  { name: "App-Name", value: "ArtGallery-v3.2" },
  { name: "Version", value: "3.2.1" },
  { name: "License", value: "udl-tx-id-here" },
  { name: "License-Fee", value: "1000000" }, // Fee in Winston
];
```

## App-Name Best Practices

### Naming Convention

Use descriptive, versioned App-Name values for better organization:

- **Include version**: `MyApp-v1.0`, `PhotoGallery-2024`
- **Be specific**: `EcommerceStore-v2.1` instead of just `Store`
- **Use consistent format**: `ProjectName-vMajor.Minor`
- **Include year for time-based apps**: `YearlyReport-2024`

## Tag Limitations

- **4KB total** for bundled data items (Turbo)
- **2KB total** for direct L1 uploads
- **No maximum number of tags** (limited by total size)
- Tag names are case-sensitive
- No duplicate tag names allowed

  **Important:** Total tag size is limited to 4KB (bundled) or 2KB (L1). For
  larger metadata, store it in the data payload instead.

## Querying Data by Tags

Once you've tagged your data, you can use GraphQL to search and filter based on those tags. This enables powerful discovery and retrieval of your stored content.

# Paying for Uploads (/build/upload/turbo-credits)

import {
  CreditCard,
  Upload,
  Code,
  FileText,
  Tag,
  FolderOpen,
} from "lucide-react";

Turbo Credits are the payment medium used by Turbo's upload service, providing a 1:1 conversion from Arweave's native AR token with additional benefits and flexible payment options.

## What are Turbo Credits?

Turbo Credits represent upload power on the Arweave network, divisible down to 1 trillionth of a credit (Winston Credit). Unlike traditional crypto tokens, Turbo Credits cannot be traded, transferred, or exchanged - they exist solely for uploading data to Arweave.

  **Important:** Turbo Credits are non-refundable and cannot be withdrawn or
  exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.

## How to Purchase Credits

### Payment Methods

- **Fiat Currency**: Credit/debit cards via Stripe
- **Crypto Tokens**: AR, ETH, SOL, MATIC, ARIO, USDC, KYVE, ETH (BASE)
- **Multiple Wallets**: Ethereum, Solana, and Arweave wallets supported

### Supported Tokens & Purchase Methods

| Payment Method               | Turbo SDK | Turbo CLI | Turbo API | Top Up App | ArDrive App |

# Glossary (/glossary)

## AO Computer

AO (Actor Oriented) is a hyper-parallel computing platform built on Arweave that enables decentralized applications to run with unlimited computational capacity. AO provides the compute layer for the AR.IO Network's smart contracts and token operations.

## Public Key

A cryptographic key that can be shared publicly and is used to verify digital signatures or encrypt data. In the AR.IO context, public keys are used to identify wallet addresses and verify transactions.

## Native Address

An address format that uses the raw public key bytes directly, without additional encoding or transformation. This is the most basic form of an Arweave address.

## Normalized Address

A standardized address format that ensures consistent representation across different systems and contexts. Normalized addresses help prevent issues with address matching and lookup operations.

## Optimistic Indexing

A data indexing strategy where new data is immediately made available for queries while verification processes continue in the background. This approach improves performance while maintaining data integrity through eventual consistency.

# What are Bundles? (/learn/(introduction)/ans-104-bundles)

ANS-104 bundles are **data packaging standards** that efficiently bundle multiple data items and submit them to Arweave as single transactions, reducing transaction overhead and improving network efficiency.

## The Problem ANS-104 Solves

**Individual Arweave transactions have inherent limitations:**

- **Transaction overhead** - Each transaction requires separate processing and storage
- **Network inefficiency** - Multiple small transactions consume more network resources
- **Indexing complexity** - Individual transactions are harder to organize and query
- **Storage fragmentation** - Related data items are stored separately

**ANS-104 provides:**

- **Reduced transaction overhead** by batching multiple data items
- **Improved network efficiency** through consolidated transactions
- **Better indexing capabilities** with structured data item format
- **Standardized data format** for interoperability across applications

## How ANS-104 Bundling Works

### The ANS-104 Standard

ANS-104 is the [official specification](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-104.md) for bundling data on Arweave:

- **Data Items** - Individual pieces of data with standardized binary format
- **Bundle** - Single Arweave transaction containing multiple data items
- **Binary Serialization** - Consistent format for data item structure
- **Standardized Format** - Ensures interoperability across applications

### How ANS-104 Works

1. **Data Item Creation** - Create individual data items with ANS-104 format
2. **Bundle Assembly** - Combine multiple data items into a single bundle
3. **Transaction Creation** - Submit bundle as one Arweave transaction
4. **Network Processing** - Miners process the single bundle transaction
5. **Data Retrieval** - Individual data items can be extracted and indexed

## Key Benefits of ANS-104

**Reduced Overhead** - Bundle multiple data items into a single transaction to reduce processing overhead

**Network Efficiency** - Consolidate multiple uploads into fewer network transactions

**Standardized Format** - Consistent binary serialization ensures interoperability across applications

**Better Indexing** - Structured data item format enables more efficient data retrieval and querying

## Why ANS-104 Matters for the Permaweb

ANS-104 bundles are essential for building scalable applications on the permaweb because they:

- **Enable efficient data storage** by reducing transaction overhead for multiple data items
- **Improve network performance** through consolidated transactions
- **Support better data organization** with standardized data item formats
- **Enable scalable applications** that need to store many related data items efficiently

# What is the Permaweb? (/learn/(introduction)/permaweb)

The **permaweb** is a decentralized, permanent layer of the internet where data, applications, and websites are stored forever and remain accessible through a global network of gateways.

## How the Permaweb Works

Unlike the traditional web where data can disappear when servers go offline, the permaweb creates a **permanent archive of human knowledge** through a multi-layer architecture:

**Foundation**: Arweave blockchain provides immutable storage  
**Computation**: AO and other platforms enable smart contracts and processing  
**Access**: AR.IO gateway network makes everything accessible globally  
**Users**: Developers and users interact through familiar web interfaces

This architecture ensures that once something is published to the permaweb, it remains accessible forever, creating a truly permanent internet.

## Permaweb Network Architecture

The permaweb operates through a layered system architecture where each component provides specialized services to create a permanent, decentralized internet.

    Applications & Users
    
      Web Apps, dApps, Developers, End Users

      AO
      
        Decentralized Compute

      AR.IO
      
        Decentralized Access

    Arweave
    
      Permanent Storage Foundation

## Permaweb Architecture: How It All Connects

The permaweb operates through a **four-layer architecture** where each layer serves a specific purpose in creating permanent, accessible internet infrastructure:

### Layer 1: Permanent Storage (Arweave)
**Core Responsibility: Forever Data Preservation**

Arweave's primary job is to **store data permanently** with mathematical guarantees:
- **Immutable storage** - Once written, data cannot be changed or deleted
- **Economic sustainability** - Endowment model ensures miners are paid to store data forever
- **Cryptographic verification** - Proof that data exists and hasn't been tampered with
- **Decentralized replication** - Data survives even if most miners go offline

### Layer 2: Decentralized Compute (AO)
**Core Responsibility: Smart Contract Execution**

AO's primary job is to **run programs that work with permanent data**:
- **Process execution** - Runs smart contracts and applications on permanent data
- **Message routing** - Enables communication between different processes
- **State management** - Maintains application state using permanent storage
- **Parallel computation** - Scales processing across multiple nodes

### Layer 3: Decentralized Access (AR.IO)
**Core Responsibility: Data Access & Discovery**

AR.IO's primary job is to **make permanent data fast and accessible**:
- **Data retrieval** - Fetches and serves content from Arweave storage
- **Content indexing** - Organizes and catalogs data for search and discovery
- **ArNS resolution** - Converts human-readable names to Arweave transaction IDs
- **Performance optimization** - Caches popular content for faster access
- **Quality assurance** - Validates data integrity and provides reliable access

### Layer 4: Applications & Users
**Core Responsibility: User Interface & Experience**

Applications and users are responsible for **interacting with the permanent web**:
- **User interfaces** - Create familiar web experiences backed by permanent data
- **Data submission** - Upload new content and applications to the permaweb
- **Application logic** - Build decentralized apps using permanent storage and compute
- **Content consumption** - Browse, search, and interact with permanent web content

## The Vision of the Permaweb

The permaweb represents a fundamental shift from the ephemeral nature of today's internet to a permanent, censorship-resistant foundation for human knowledge and applications. By combining Arweave's immutable storage with AO's decentralized compute and AR.IO's accessible gateway network, the permaweb creates an internet where data never disappears, applications run without central points of failure, and users maintain true ownership of their digital assets.

This architecture enables a new generation of applications that can operate indefinitely without relying on traditional hosting services, where digital artifacts become truly permanent, and where the collective knowledge of humanity is preserved for future generations. The permaweb isn't just about storing data forever—it's about building a more resilient, equitable, and permanent foundation for the digital world.

# What is AR.IO? (/learn/(introduction)/what-is-ario)

The AR.IO Network is the first permanent cloud network.

A decentralized infrastructure layer built on Arweave and AO, making permanent data accessible, discoverable, and usable. Think of it as the gateway to Arweave's permaweb, turning its tamper-proof storage into a fully functional, user-friendly ecosystem for apps, websites, and data.

## Features of The AR.IO Network

### Gateways

AR.IO operates a network of [gateways](/learn/gateways) — nodes that serve as entry points to Arweave’s data. These gateways fetch and deliver data quickly, supporting everything from static files to dynamic web apps.

### Arweave Name System (ArNS)

The [Arweave Name System (ArNS)](/learn/arns) is a decentralized naming system for Arweave. It allows users to register and resolve human-readable names to Arweave transaction IDs.

### Data Access

AR.IO offers a range of tools for accessing and querying data on Arweave, including:

- [HTTP Requests](/build/access/fetch-data) via gateways
- [GraphQL Queries](/build/access/find-data) for finding data by tags and metadata
- [ArNS](/learn/arns) for human-readable URLs
- [Wayfinder](/learn/wayfinder) for decentralized content discovery

## The Problem

Arweave stores data forever, but accessing and organizing that data isn't always straightforward. Without efficient tools, retrieving files, serving websites, or finding specific content on Arweave's blockweave can be slow or complex, limiting its potential for developers and users.

## The Solution

The AR.IO Network builds on Arweave's permanent storage to create a decentralized, scalable access layer. It provides gateways, domain names, and indexing services, making it easy to interact with permaweb content as seamlessly as the traditional web.

### How It Works

- **Decentralized Gateways**: AR.IO operates a network of gateways—nodes that serve as entry points to Arweave’s data. These gateways fetch and deliver data quickly, supporting everything from static files to dynamic web apps.

- **ArNS (Arweave Name Service)**: AR.IO introduces decentralized domain names (e.g., yourname.arweave), mapping human-readable names to Arweave’s data IDs. This makes content easy to find and share, like URLs on the traditional web.

- **Indexing and Querying**: AR.IO enables efficient data indexing, allowing developers to search and retrieve specific content from Arweave’s vast storage without scanning the entire blockweave.

- **Routing and verification**: AR.IO 's ar://wayfinder Protocol intelligently routes requests to available gateways in the network and verifies the data's authenticity.

- **Observation and incentives**: ARIO's [Observation and Incentive Protocol (OIP)](/learn/oip), ensures gateway operators are serving the right data and rewards them in the protocol native token, $ARIO, to create a secure and self-sustaining network.

**In Simple Terms**: Imagine Arweave as a massive, unerasable library. The AR.IO Network is the librarian who organizes the shelves, provides a catalog, and hands you the books you need—fast.

## Why It Matters

- **Accessible**: Gateways make permaweb content load as quickly as traditional websites.

- **Discoverable**: ArNS provides user-friendly domain names, simplifying navigation.

- **Scalable**: Supports growing permaweb usage, from small apps to global platforms.

- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls access, ensuring censorship resistance.

## Building on The AR.IO Network

The AR.IO Network empowers developers to create permaweb apps with tools for hosting, querying, and monetizing content, all while leveraging Arweave's permanent storage.

**In Simple Terms**: Arweave locks data forever; The AR.IO Network makes it ready for the world to use.

# What is Arweave? (/learn/(introduction)/what-is-arweave)

Arweave is a decentralized storage network that ensures data is **permanent**, **affordable**, and **scalable**. Think of it as a global, tamper-proof hard drive where your files—photos, documents, or apps—stay accessible forever. It's the foundation for the [AR.IO Network](https://ar.io), powering a "permaweb" where data never disappears.

Below, we break down Arweave's core features in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

## A Datachain for Permanent Storage

Arweave is like Bitcoin, but for data. It solves one problem really well: **storing data permanently**. Once uploaded, your data—whether a tweet, NFT, or website—is immutable and preserved indefinitely.

### How Does It Work?

- **Blockweave Architecture**: Unlike a blockchain's single chain, Arweave's blockweave links each new data block to the previous one and a random older block. Data is split into 256 KiB chunks in a secure Merkle tree, ensuring miners keep all data to add new blocks.

- **Succinct Proofs of Random Access (SPoRA)**: Miners prove they store multiple data copies by accessing random chunks, verified efficiently with Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs). This combines proof-of-work and proof-of-storage, making data loss nearly impossible.

**In Simple Terms**: Picture a library where new books reference older ones, and librarians must keep every book to add more. SPoRA ensures they prove they’ve got the books, keeping your data safe forever.

## Pay Once, Store Forever: No Recurring Fees

Pay a one-time fee to upload data, and it's stored "forever"—no subscriptions or renewals.

### How Does It Work?

- **Endowment Fund**: Your fee, based on 200 years of storage for 20 replicas, goes mostly into a fund that slowly pays miners in AR tokens to maintain data. It assumes storage costs drop over time, making the fund sustainable.

**In Simple Terms**: It's a “forever stamp” for data. Your payment funds a pot that keeps paying storage keepers, lasting longer as tech gets cheaper.

## Practically Unlimited Storage

Arweave can practically store unlimited data, from small files to entire digital archives, without hitting a ceiling. The theoretical limit is 2^256 bytes which for scale is more atoms than there are in the universe.

### How Does It Work?

- **Layer 1 Transactions**: Data is stored as 256 KiB chunks on the blockweave, replicated across many nodes. As more nodes join with standard hardware, storage capacity grows limitlessly.

- **Bundling with [AR.IO Network](https://ar.io) and Turbo**: Bundling packs multiple files into one transaction, reducing costs and congestion. AR.IO Network and Turbo (a Layer 2 tool) optimize this, enabling fast, cheap uploads of large datasets like websites.

## What Arweave doesn't solve well? Access

Arweave solve's one problem and solve's it well. Storing your data for a very long-time.

It doesn't, however, incentivise the indexing and access for data.

## Ready to Dive Deeper?

Arweave powers a permaweb where apps, websites and data live forever. For AR.IO Network developers, it's the bedrock for unstoppable decentralized applications. Learn more in the next section: [What is AR.IO Network](/learn/what-is-ario).

# Arweave Name Tokens (ANTs) (/learn/arns/ants)

To establish ownership of a record in the ArNS Registry, each record contains both a friendly name and a reference to an Arweave Name Token, ANT. Name Tokens are unique AO Computer based tokens/processes that give their owners the ability to update the Arweave Transaction IDs that their associated friendly names point to.

## What is an ANT?

The ANT smart contract process is a standardized contract that implements the specific Arweave Name Process specification required by AR.IO gateways who resolve ArNS names and their Arweave Transaction IDs. It also contains other basic functionality to establish ownership and the ability to transfer ownership and update the Arweave Transaction ID.

Name Tokens have an owner, who can transfer the token and control its modifiable settings. These settings include modifying the address resolution time to live (ttl) for each name contained in the ANT, and other settings like the ANT Name, Ticker, and an ANT Controller.

## Ownership and Control

The controller can only manage the ANT and set and update records, name, and the ticker, but cannot transfer the ANT. Note that ANTs are initially created in accordance with network standards by an end user who then has the ability to transfer its ownership or assign a controller as they see fit.

Owners of names should ensure their ANT supports evolve ability if future modifications are desired. Loss of a private key for a permanently purchased name can result in the name being "bricked".

### Under_name Ownership

Undernames can have an `owner` set on them. This owner is empowered to set that undername as their primary name, can remove that undername as their primary name, and has full control over that Undername's metadata, such as:

- Transaction Id - the data the record resolves to.
- TTL Seconds - the Time To Live in seconds the data is cached for by clients.
- Owner - the owner of the record.
- Description - the description of the record.
- Display Name - the display name for the owner of the record.
- Keywords - the keywords for the record.
- Logo - the logo of the record.

They do *NOT* have control over the `priority` of the undername, which is restricted to the ANT Controllers and Owner.

## ANT Interactions

The table below indicates some of the possible interactions with the ArNS registry, corresponding ANTs, and who can perform them:

## Under_names

ANT owners and controllers can configure multiple subdomains for their registered ArNS name known as "under_names" or more easily written "undernames". These undernames are assigned individually at the time of registration or can be added on to any registered name at any time.

Under*names use an underscore "*" in place of a more typically used dot "." to separate the subdomain from the main ArNS domain.

## Secondary Markets

Secondary markets could be created by ecosystem partners that facilitate the trading of Name Tokens. Additionally, tertiary markets could be created that support the leasing of these friendly names to other users. Such markets, if any, would be created by third parties unrelated to and outside of the scope of this paper or control of the Foundation.

# Arweave Name System (ArNS) (/learn/arns)

## What is ArNS?

Arweave URLs and transaction IDs are long, difficult to remember, and occasionally categorized as spam. The Arweave Name System (ArNS) aims to resolve these problems in a decentralized manner.

ArNS is a **censorship-resistant naming system** stored on Arweave, powered by [ARIO tokens](/learn/token), enabled through [AR.IO gateway](/learn/gateways) domains, and used to connect friendly domain names to permaweb apps, web pages, data, and identities.

It's an open, permissionless, domain name registrar that doesn't rely on a single TLD.

## How ArNS Works

This system works similarly to traditional DNS services, where users can purchase a name in a registry and DNS Name servers resolve these names to IP addresses. The system is flexible and allows users to purchase names permanently or lease them for a defined duration based on their use case.

With ArNS, the registry is stored permanently on Arweave via [AO](/glossary), making it immutable and globally resilient. This also means that apps and infrastructure cannot just read the latest state of the registry but can also check any point in time in the past, creating a "Wayback Machine" of permanent data.

    style TX3 fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333
```

## Name Resolution

Users can register a name, like `ardrive`, within the ArNS Registry. Before owning a name, they must create an Arweave Name Token (ANT), an AO Computer based token and open-source protocol used by ArNS to track the ownership and control over the name.

ANTs allow the owner to set a mutable pointer to any type of permaweb data, like a page, app or file, via its Arweave transaction ID.

Each AR.IO gateway acts as an ArNS Name resolver. They fetch the latest state of both the ArNS Registry and its associated ANTs from an AO compute unit (CU) and serve this information rapidly for apps and users.

AR.IO gateways will also resolve that name as one of their own subdomains, e.g., `https://ardrive.arweave.net` and proxy all requests to the associated Arweave transaction ID. This means that ANTs work across all AR.IO gateways that support them: `https://ardrive.ar-io.dev`, `https://ardrive.g8way.io/`, etc.

Users can easily reference these friendly names in their browsers, and other applications and infrastructure can build rich solutions on top of these ArNS primitives.

```mermaid

    end
    Gateway-->>User: Serves content
```

## Key Benefits

# Name Registration (/learn/arns/name-registration)

There are two different types of name registrations that can be utilized based upon the needs of the user:

## Registration Types

### Lease Registration

A name may be **leased on a yearly basis**. A leased name can have its lease extended or renewed but only up to a maximum active lease of **five (5) years** at any time.

### Permanent Registration (Permabuy)

A name may be **purchased for an indefinite duration** with no expiration date.

Registering a name requires spending ARIO tokens corresponding to the name's character length and purchase type.

## Name Registry

The ArNS Registry is a list of all registered names and their associated ANT Process IDs. Key rules embedded within the smart contract include:

- **Genesis Prices**: Set within the contract as starting conditions
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Varies based on name length, purchase type (lease vs buy), lease duration, and current Demand Factor
- **Name Records**: Include a pointer to the Arweave Name Token process identifier, lease end time (if applicable), and undername allocation
- **Reassignment**: Name registrations can be reassigned from one ANT to another
- **Lease Extension**: Anyone with available ARIO Tokens can extend any name's active lease
- **Lease to Permanent Buy**: Anyone with available ARIO Tokens can convert a name's lease to a permanent buy
- **Undername Capacity**: Additional undername capacity can be purchased for any actively registered name
- **Name Removal**: Name records can only be removed from the registry if a lease expires, or a permanent name is returned to the protocol

## Name Validation Rules

All names registered must meet the following criteria:

1. **Valid characters**: Only numbers 0-9, characters a-z and dashes
2. **Dash placement**: Dashes cannot be leading or trailing characters
3. **Single character domains**: Dashes cannot be used in single character domains
4. **Length limits**: 1 character minimum, 51 characters maximum
5. **Reserved names**: Cannot be an invalid name predesignated to prevent unintentional use/abuse such as `www`

## Lease Management

### Lease Expirations

When a lease term ends, there is a **grace period of two (2) weeks** where the lease can be renewed before it fully expires. If this grace period elapses, the name is considered expired and returns to the protocol for public registration. Once expired, a name's associated undername registrations and capacity also expire.

A recently expired name's registration shall be priced subject to the "Returned Name Premium" mechanics.

### Lease to Permabuy Conversions

An actively leased name may be converted to a permanent registration. The price for this conversion shall be treated as if it were a new permanent name purchase.

This functionality allows users to transition from leasing to permanent ownership based on changing needs and available resources. It generates additional protocol revenue through conversion fees, contributing to the ecosystem's financial health and reward system.

### Permanent Name Return

Users have the option to "return" their permanently registered names back to the protocol. This process allows users to relinquish their ownership, returning the name to the protocol for public re-registration. Only the Owner of a name can initiate a name return.

When a permanent name is returned, the name is subject to a "Returned Name Premium", similar to expired leases. A key difference is that if the name is repurchased during the premium window, the proceeds are split between the returning owner and the protocol balance.

## Primary Names

The Arweave Name System (ArNS) supports the designation of a "Primary Name" for users, simplifying how Arweave addresses are displayed across applications. A Primary Name is a user-friendly alias that replaces complex wallet addresses, making interactions and profiles easier to manage and identify.

Users can set one of their owned ArNS names as their Primary Name, subject to a small fee. This allows applications to use a single, human-readable identifier for a wallet, improving user experience across the network.

## Next Steps

Now that you understand name registration, learn about [Arweave Name Tokens (ANTs)](/learn/arns/ants) to see how ownership and control work, or explore the [Pricing Model](/learn/arns/pricing-model) to understand how costs are calculated.

# Pricing Model (/learn/arns/pricing-model)

## Addressing Variable Market Conditions

The future market landscape is unpredictable, and the AR.IO Network smart contract is designed to be immutable, operating without governance or manual intervention. Using a pricing oracle to fix name prices relative to a stable currency is not viable due to the infancy of available solutions and reliance on external dependencies.

To address these challenges, ArNS is self-contained and adaptive, with name prices reflecting network activity and market conditions over time.

To achieve this, ArNS incorporates:

1. A **dynamic pricing model** that adjusts fees using a "Demand Factor" based on ArNS purchase activity
2. A **Returned Name Premium (RNP)** system that applies a timed, descending multiplier to registration prices for names that have recently expired or been returned to the protocol

This approach ensures that name valuations adapt to market conditions within the constraints of an immutable, maintenance-free smart contract framework.

You can view current live pricing at [ArNS.app](https://arns.ar.io/#/prices) to see these formulas in action.

## Key Definitions

- **Protocol Revenue:** Accumulated ARIO tokens from name registrations, lease extensions, and under_name sales
- **Period (P):** The time unit for DF adjustments, equivalent to one (1) day, denoted in milliseconds
- **n:** The current period indicator
- **Price:** The cost for permabuy or lease of a name
- **Under_names:** Subdomain equivalents, denoted by an underscore "\_" prefixing the base domain

## Dynamic Pricing Model

ArNS employs an adaptive pricing model to balance market demand with pricing fairness for name registration within the network. This model integrates static and dynamic elements, adjusting prices based on name length and purchase options like leasing, permanent acquisition, and undername amounts.

### Core Pricing Components

#### Base Registration Fee (BRF)

The fundamental price for names, varying by character length, adjusted periodically.

#### Genesis Registration Fee (GRF)

The starting price for name registrations varies by character length. This is superseded by Base Registration Fees as the protocol evolves.

**Table: Genesis Registration Fees**

| Name Length | Fee (ARIO) |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 1           | 1,000,000  |
| 2           | 200,000    |
| 3           | 20,000     |
| 4           | 10,000     |
| 5           | 2,500      |
| 6           | 1,500      |
| 7           | 800        |
| 8           | 500        |
| 9           | 400        |
| 10          | 350        |
| 11          | 300        |
| 12          | 250        |
| 13-51       | 200        |

#### Demand Factor (DF)

A global price multiplier, reflecting namespace demand, adjusted each period based on revenue trends.

**DF Mechanics:**

- **Intent:** The Demand Factor adjusts based on protocol revenue comparison to the Revenue Moving Average (RMA)
- **Increase DF:** When recent revenue is higher than or equal to (but non-zero) the RMA, the DF increases by 5.0%
- **Decrease DF:** When recent revenue is less than the RMA or both are zero, the DF decreases by 1.5%
- **Maximum DF Value:** Unbounded
- **Minimum DF Value:** 0.5
- **Starting Demand Factor:** 1 (initial value at network launch)

#### Revenue Moving Average (RMA)

The average of protocol revenue from the past seven (7) periods.

### Pricing Formulas

#### Adjusted Registration Fee (ARF)

```math
ARF = BRF × DF
```

#### Annual Fee

```math
Annual ~Fee = ARF × 20%
```

#### Lease Pricing

- **Lease Registration Price:**

```math
Lease ~Price = ARF + (Annual ~Fee × Years)
```

- **Lease Extension/Renewal Price:**

```math
Lease ~Renewal ~Price = Annual ~Fee × Years (max 5 years)
```

- **Grace period:** Two (2) weeks

#### Permanent Purchases

- **Permabuy Price:**

```math
Permabuy ~Price = ARF + (Annual Fee × 20 years)
```

- **Lease to Permabuy Price:** Same as above

#### Under Name Fees

- **Initial Allocation:** 10 `under_names` are included with each name registration
- **For Leases:**

```math
Lease ~Under ~Name ~Fee = BRF × DF × 0.1%
```

- **For Permabuys:**

```math
Permabuy ~Under ~Name ~Fee = BRF × DF × 0.5%
```

#### Primary Name Fee

Set or change primary name: The fee is equal to the associated fee for a single `under_name` purchase of a 51-character name of equivalent purchase type to the new primary name, regardless of the new primary name's length.

### Step Pricing Mechanics

- Synchronizes BRF (Base Rate Factor) with ARF (Adjusted Rate Factor) after seven (7) consecutive periods at the minimum DF value
- Resets DF to 1 following a step pricing adjustment

## Returned Name Premiums (RNP)

ArNS applies a **Returned Name Premium (RNP)** to names that re-enter the market after expiration or permanent return. This premium starts at a maximum value and decreases linearly over a predefined window, ensuring fair and transparent pricing for re-registered names.

### RNP Mechanics

#### Intent

The premium starts at its maximum and decreases linearly until the name is purchased. If the name is not purchased before the premium window closes, it reverts to standard pricing and is no longer classified as "recently returned."

#### RNP Window

- **Duration:** Fourteen (14) periods

#### Returned Name Premium Formula

The premium multiplier follows a linearly declining function:

```math
RNP = 50 - (49 / 14) × t
```

Where:

- **RNP:** The Returned Name Premium multiplier applied to the purchased name price
- **t:** Amount of time (or time-intervals) elapsed since the start of the return window

#### RNP Registration Price

```math
Price = RNP × (Lease~Or~Permabuy) ~Registration~ Price
```

#### Permanent Name Return Proceeds Split

- **50%** goes to the returning name owner
- **50%** goes to the protocol balance

The RNP multiplier is applied to the registration price of both permanently purchased and leased names.

# Architecture (/learn/gateways/architecture)

AR.IO gateways are sophisticated data access layers built on top of the Arweave network. They transform the raw Arweave blockchain into a performant, reliable, and developer-friendly platform for storing and retrieving data. Gateways act as bridges between applications and the permanent storage capabilities of Arweave.

## Core Technology Stack

AR.IO gateways are built using modern, scalable technologies designed for high-performance data operations:

### Runtime and Language
- **Node.js**: The primary runtime environment for all gateway services
- **TypeScript**: Core services written with flexible interfaces for customization
- **Event-driven architecture**: Enables efficient handling of concurrent operations

### Data Storage
- **SQLite**: Four specialized databases handle different aspects of gateway operations:
  - Chain data indexing
  - Bundle transaction processing  
  - Data item management
  - Configuration and metadata
- **Redis**: High-speed caching layer for frequently accessed data
- **File system storage**: Local caching for frequently accessed data

### Processing Model
- **Worker-based concurrency**: Specialized workers handle different background tasks
- **Event-driven processing**: Loosely coupled components communicate via events
- **Streaming data handling**: Minimizes memory overhead for large data operations

## Key Architectural Decisions

Several important design decisions shape how AR.IO gateways operate:

### Data Retrieval Strategy
AR.IO gateways use a sophisticated **hierarchical fallback system** for data retrieval:

1. **Trusted gateways**: Prioritize data from verified, high-performance peers
2. **AR.IO network**: Leverage the broader network of AR.IO gateways  
3. **Chunks data items**: Reconstruct data from individual chunks when needed
4. **Transaction data**: Fall back to raw Arweave transaction data

This approach ensures data availability while optimizing for speed and reliability.

### Verification and Trust Model
- **Multi-level cryptographic verification**: Data integrity is verified at multiple points
- **Trust hierarchy**: Cached verified data → trusted cached data → network streams
- **Self-healing mechanisms**: Automatic recovery and re-verification of corrupted data
- **Verification headers**: HTTP headers indicate the verification status of returned data

### Worker Specialization
Different background workers handle specific responsibilities:

- **Block synchronization workers**: Keep the gateway synchronized with Arweave blocks
- **Bundle processing workers**: Handle Layer 2 bundled data items (ANS-104)
- **Data verification workers**: Continuously verify stored data integrity
- **Maintenance workers**: Perform cleanup and optimization tasks

## Scalability and Configuration

AR.IO gateways are designed to scale from small personal deployments to large enterprise installations:

### Modular Architecture
Gateway services can be independently configured or disabled based on operator needs:
- **Data serving**: Serve cached data to applications
- **Data indexing**: Index and process new Arweave data
- **Bundle processing**: Handle Layer 2 bundled transactions
- **ArNS routing**: Provide Arweave Name System resolution

## Core Philosophy: Builder Independence

A fundamental principle of AR.IO gateway architecture is **empowering builders to do the things they care about** without relying on any centralized resource to leverage Arweave. This philosophy manifests in several key ways:

### Extensibility Through Modularity
Gateways are designed as extensible platforms that operators can customize through **[Extensions](/build/extensions/)**, sidecar services, and plugin architectures for specialized functionality.

### Data Sovereignty
Operators maintain complete control through **[Data Retrieval](/learn/gateways/data-retrieval)** strategies and **[Data Verification](/learn/gateways/data-verification)** systems that ensure independence from trusted intermediaries.

### Network Resilience
The modular design creates a resilient ecosystem where distributed infrastructure and customizable trust models prevent single points of failure.

This architecture ensures that builders can create powerful applications on Arweave while maintaining independence from any centralized infrastructure or service provider.

# Data Retrieval (/learn/gateways/data-retrieval)

AR.IO gateways use a sophisticated multi-tier architecture to retrieve and serve Arweave data. This system ensures high availability, fast response times, and data integrity by leveraging multiple data sources with automatic fallback mechanisms.

## How Gateways Retrieve Data

When a gateway needs to serve data, it follows a hierarchical retrieval pattern, trying each source in order until the data is successfully retrieved:

```mermaid

    class TRUSTED,NETWORK,CHUNKS,TXDATA source
    class VALIDATE,SERVE,STORE process
```

## Data Sources

AR.IO gateways can retrieve data from multiple sources, each with different characteristics:

### 1. Trusted Gateways
- **Purpose**: Peer-to-peer data sharing between verified AR.IO gateways
- **Benefits**: Distributed redundancy, load balancing, network resilience
- **Trust Mechanism**: Performance-based trust scores and reciprocity monitoring
- **Selection**: Prioritized based on established trust relationships

### 2. AR.IO Network (Untrusted Peers)
- **Purpose**: Broader network of AR.IO gateways without established trust
- **Benefits**: Geographic distribution, expanded data availability
- **Selection**: Weighted random selection based on performance metrics
- **Validation**: Enhanced verification required due to untrusted nature

### 3. Chunk Assembly
- **Purpose**: Direct reconstruction from Arweave chunks via known offsets
- **Benefits**: Data integrity guarantee, no intermediary trust required
- **Process**: Fetches individual chunks efficiently and assembles them into complete data
- **Optimization**: Uses offset awareness for faster chunk retrieval

### 4. TX Data
- **Purpose**: Direct access to transaction data from Arweave nodes
- **Benefits**: Authoritative data source, complete historical access
- **Trade-off**: Higher latency but guaranteed availability
- **Use Case**: Final fallback when other sources fail

## Retrieval Strategies

Gateways employ different strategies based on the use case:

### On-Demand Retrieval
Optimized for user requests with emphasis on speed:
1. **Priority order**: Trusted Gateways → Untrusted Peers (AR.IO Network) → Chunks Assembly → Arweave
2. **Aggressive timeouts**: Quick fallback to next source
3. **Parallel attempts**: May query multiple sources simultaneously
4. **Response streaming**: Begin serving data as soon as available

### Background Retrieval
Used specifically for unbundling and verification processes:
1. **Unbundling operations**: Extracting individual data items from ANS-104 bundles
2. **Data verification**: Comprehensive validation of retrieved data integrity
3. **Integrity focus**: Prefers authoritative sources for accurate processing
4. **Relaxed timeouts**: Allows for slower but reliable retrieval during verification
5. **Verification priority**: Extensive validation before caching verified data

## Trust and Validation

### Peer Trust Management
Gateways maintain sophisticated trust relationships:

```mermaid

    classDef metric fill:#7c3aed,stroke:#6d28d9,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    class LATENCY,SUCCESS,VALIDITY metric
```

Trust factors include:
- **Response performance**: Latency and throughput metrics
- **Success rates**: Percentage of successful requests
- **Data validity**: Cryptographic verification results
- **Reciprocity**: Mutual data sharing behavior

### Data Validation Process
Every piece of retrieved data undergoes validation:

1. **Hash Verification**: Computed hash must match expected value
2. **Merkle Proof Validation**: Chunks proven against transaction root
3. **Signature Verification**: Transaction signatures validated
4. **Size Confirmation**: Data size matches header declaration

## Why Multi-Source Retrieval Matters

### For Gateway Operators
- **Reduced infrastructure costs**: Leverage peer resources
- **Improved reliability**: Multiple fallback options
- **Better performance**: Optimal source selection
- **Network effects**: Benefit from collective infrastructure

### For Users
- **Faster access**: Data served from optimal source
- **High availability**: Multiple paths to data
- **Geographic optimization**: Nearby sources preferred
- **Consistent experience**: Transparent source selection

# Data Verification (/learn/gateways/data-verification)

AR.IO gateways continuously verify that data chunks are correctly stored and retrievable from Arweave. This ensures users receive authentic, uncorrupted data with cryptographic proof of integrity. The verification system is what makes AR.IO gateways trustworthy data providers for the permaweb.

## How Gateways Verify Data

Data verification is an ongoing process that uses Merkle tree cryptography to provide mathematical proof of data integrity. The process involves multiple specialized components working together to ensure cached data matches what's stored on Arweave:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Scheduler
    participant Worker as DataVerificationWorker
    participant ContigIndex as ContiguousDataIndex
    participant RootTxIndex as DataItemRootTxIndex
    participant DataRootComp as DataRootComputer
    participant DataSource as ContiguousDataSource
    participant Importer as DataImporter
    participant Bundler as BundleQueue

    Note over Scheduler,Bundler: Data Discovery Phase
    Scheduler->>Worker: Triggers queueRootTx() periodically
    Worker->>ContigIndex: getVerifiableDataIds()
    ContigIndex-->>Worker: Returns list of data IDs
    
    loop For each dataId
        Worker->>RootTxIndex: getRootTxId(dataId)
        RootTxIndex-->>Worker: Returns rootTxId
        Worker->>Worker: Enqueue rootTxId if not processed
    end

    Note over Scheduler,Bundler: Verification Phase
    Worker->>ContigIndex: getDataAttributes(rootTxId)
    ContigIndex-->>Worker: Returns attributes (indexedDataRoot, hash)

    alt indexedDataRoot is present
        Worker->>DataRootComp: computeDataRoot(rootTxId)
        DataRootComp->>DataSource: getData(rootTxId)
        DataSource-->>DataRootComp: Returns data stream
        DataRootComp-->>Worker: Returns computedDataRoot

        alt computedDataRoot matches indexedDataRoot
            Worker->>ContigIndex: saveVerificationStatus(rootTxId)
            ContigIndex-->>Worker: ✓ Verification Success
            Note over Worker: Data is now verified and cached for serving
        else computedDataRoot does NOT match
            Worker->>Importer: queueItem({id: rootTxId}, priority=true)
            Importer-->>Worker: Queued for re-import from Arweave
        end
    else indexedDataRoot is MISSING
        Worker->>Bundler: queueBundle({id: rootTxId})
        Bundler-->>Worker: Queued for bundle unbundling
    end
```

**The Verification Workflow:**

Gateways achieve verification through a systematic five-phase process orchestrated by the DataVerificationWorker. This process ensures that every piece of cached data cryptographically matches its original form on Arweave, providing mathematical proof of integrity before serving data to users.

**1. Discovery Phase**
- Periodically scan for unverified data items
- Priority-based queue management (higher priority items first)
- Track retry attempts for failed verifications

**2. Data Retrieval**
- Fetch data attributes from gateway storage
- Retrieve the complete data stream
- Gather metadata needed for verification

**3. Cryptographic Computation**
- Calculate Merkle data root from actual data stream
- Generate cryptographic proofs using the same algorithm as Arweave
- Create verifiable hash chains

**4. Root Comparison**
- Compare computed root against indexed root in database
- Verify data hasn't been corrupted or altered
- Validate chunk integrity against Merkle proofs

**5. Action Based on Results**
- **Success**: Mark data as verified with timestamp
- **Failure**: Trigger re-import from Arweave or unbundle from parent
- **Error**: Increment retry counter and requeue for later

## Verification Types

AR.IO gateways handle different types of data verification based on the data's origin:

### Transaction Data Verification
For individual Arweave transactions:
- **Direct root validation** against transaction data roots stored on-chain
- **Complete data reconstruction** from chunks to ensure availability
- **Cryptographic proof** that data matches what was originally stored

### Bundle Data Verification
For ANS-104 data bundles (collections of data items):
- **Bundle integrity checks** to verify the container is valid
- **Individual item verification** within each bundle
- **Recursive unbundling** when verification fails to re-extract items
- **Nested bundle support** for bundles containing other bundles

### Chunk-Level Validation
At the most granular level:
- **Merkle proof validation** for individual data chunks
- **Sequential integrity** ensuring chunks form complete data
- **Parallel verification** of multiple chunks for performance

## Why Verification Matters

### Cryptographic Trust Foundation
- **Mathematical Proof**: Merkle tree cryptography provides irrefutable proof of data integrity
- **Independent Validation**: Multiple gateways verify the same data independently
- **Network Consensus**: Distributed verification creates trust without central authority

### Data Integrity Guarantees
- **Tamper Detection**: Any alteration to data is immediately detectable
- **Corruption Recovery**: Automatic healing of corrupted data through re-import
- **Permanent Storage Validation**: Ensures Arweave's permanence promise is maintained

### Gateway Reliability
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing verification catches issues before users encounter them
- **Self-Healing System**: Automatic recovery mechanisms maintain data availability
- **Transparent Operations**: Verification status and timestamps provide audit trails

# Gateway Registry (/learn/gateways/gateway-registry)

## Overview

The AR.IO Network consists of [AR.IO gateway nodes](/learn/what-is-ario), which are identified by their registered Arweave wallet addresses and either their IP addresses or hostnames, as stored in the network's [smart contract](/learn/token) Gateway Address Registry (GAR).

Any gateway operator that wishes to join the AR.IO Network must register their node in the AR.IO smart contract's Gateway Address Registry. Registration involves staking a minimum amount of ARIO tokens and providing additional metadata describing the gateway service offered.

These nodes adhere to the AR.IO Network's protocols, creating a collaborative environment of gateway nodes that vary in scale and specialization. The network promotes a fundamental level of service quality and trust minimization among its participants.

      The gateways.ar.io portal displays all gateways currently in the network, showing their stakes, performance scores, and operational metrics

### Benefits of Joining the Network

Being part of the network grants AR.IO gateways an array of advantages:
- Simplified advertising of services and discovery by end users via the Gateway Address Registry
- More rapid bootstrapping of key gateway operational data due to prioritized data request fulfillment among gateways joined to the network
- Sharing of data processing results
- Auditability and transparency through the use of AGPL-3 licenses, which mandate public disclosure of any software changes, thereby reinforcing the network's integrity and reliability
- Improved network reliability and performance through an incentive protocol, which uses a system of evaluations and rewards to encourage high-quality service from gateways
- Eligibility to accept delegated staking improving a gateway's discoverability and reward opportunities
- **Eligibility to receive distributions from the protocol balance** - Gateways that have joined the network are eligible to receive token distributions based on their performance and contributions to the network

### How the GAR Works

After joining the network, the operator's gateway can be easily discovered by permaweb apps, its health can be observed, and it can participate in data sharing protocols. A gateway becomes eligible to participate in the network's incentive protocol in the epoch following the one they joined in.

The GAR advertises the specific attributes of each gateway including its stake, delegates, settings and services. This enables permaweb apps and users to discover which gateways are currently available and meet their needs. Apps that read the GAR can sort and filter it using the gateway metadata, for example, ranking gateways with the highest stake, reward performance, or feature set at the top of the list. This allows users to prefer the higher staked, more rewarded gateways with certain capabilities over lower staked, less rewarded gateways.

## Token Incentives and Network Monitoring

The AR.IO network uses a sophisticated incentive system to ensure gateway quality and reliability:

- **Token Incentives**: Learn more about how gateways earn rewards and participate in the network economy in the [Token section](/learn/token/)
- **Observer Protocol**: The network employs an Observer system that monitors gateway performance and ensures quality of service. Learn more about the [Observer & Incentive Protocol](/learn/oip) and how it maintains network integrity

## Recap

The Gateway Registry is the foundation of the AR.IO network's decentralized infrastructure. Key takeaways:

- **Network Participation**: Gateways must register and stake ARIO tokens to join the network
- **Protocol Distributions**: Registered gateways are eligible to receive token distributions from the protocol balance
- **Observer Monitoring**: The network employs an [Observer and Incentives Protocol](/learn/oip) that monitors gateway performance and ensures quality of service
- **Staking & Rewards**: Gateways earn rewards based on performance through a sophisticated [staking system](/learn/token/staking) that includes delegation opportunities
- **Discoverability**: The GAR enables apps and users to find suitable gateways based on their needs
- **Performance-Based Selection**: Gateway metadata allows for intelligent routing based on stake, performance, and capabilities
- **Transparent Ecosystem**: All gateway information is publicly accessible through the smart contract and at gateways.ar.io

By joining the network, gateways become part of a collaborative ecosystem that rewards quality service and ensures reliable access to the permaweb.

# AR.IO Gateways (/learn/gateways)

## What Are AR.IO Gateways?

AR.IO gateways are specialized infrastructure nodes that serve as bridges between the Arweave network and applications. They transform raw Arweave blockchain data into a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly platform for storing and retrieving permanent data.

## Core Responsibilities

AR.IO gateways handle three fundamental responsibilities:

### Data Writing & Proxying

- **Transaction relay**: Forward transaction headers to Arweave miners for mempool inclusion
- **Chunk distribution**: Proxy data chunks to Arweave nodes for storage and replication
- **Bundle processing**: Receive and bundle ANS-104 data items into base layer transactions

### Data Retrieval & Serving

- **Fast access**: Serve cached data with optimized performance and reliability
- **Multi-source fallback**: Retrieve data from trusted gateways, network peers, or directly from Arweave
- **Content delivery**: Stream complete transactions, individual chunks, or bundled data items

### Data Discovery & Indexing

- **Structured queries**: Enable efficient searches across transactions, bundles, and wallet data
- **Real-time indexing**: Process incoming data streams and maintain searchable databases
- **ArNS routing**: Provide human-readable name resolution for Arweave content

## Key Features

### Modular Architecture

Gateways are built with interchangeable components that operators can customize:

- **Configurable services**: Enable or disable features based on specific needs
- **Scalable storage**: From SQLite for small deployments to cloud databases for enterprise scale
- **Flexible infrastructure**: Adaptable to different operational environments and requirements

### Network Connectivity

- **Decentralized network**: Connect to other AR.IO gateways for data sharing and redundancy
- **Trust-minimized access**: Cryptographically verify data integrity without relying on central authorities
- **Performance optimization**: Intelligent caching and content delivery strategies

### Developer Experience

- **HTTP APIs**: Standard web interfaces for all gateway functionality
- **Monitoring & telemetry**: Built-in observability for operational insights
- **Content moderation**: Configurable policies for community and compliance needs

## What Gateways Are Not

It's important to understand the boundaries of what AR.IO gateways do and don't provide:

### Not Storage Providers

- **Don't enforce Arweave protocol**: Gateways don't validate consensus or mining rules
- **Don't guarantee permanence**: Storage permanence comes from Arweave itself, not gateways
- **Don't replicate all data**: Gateways cache popular content but aren't full blockchain replicas

### Not Compute Platforms

- **Don't depend on AO**: Gateways operate independently of any compute layer
- **Don't execute smart contracts**: Computation happens on AO or other platforms, not gateways
- **Don't process application logic**: Gateways focus purely on data access and delivery

### Not Centralized Services

- **Don't control data**: Content ownership and control remain with original creators
- **Don't gate access**: Anyone can run a gateway and access Arweave data
- **Don't create vendor lock-in**: Gateway APIs and protocols are open and interoperable

# Observation & Incentive Protocol (/learn/oip)

## Overview

The Observation and Incentive Protocol ensures network quality through peer monitoring and performance-based rewards. Gateways are incentivized to maintain high performance while also serving as "observers" that evaluate their peers' ArNS resolution capabilities and data integrity verification.

The protocol operates on **24-hour epochs** where up to 50 gateways are selected as observers to test other gateways against ArNS name resolution criteria and chunk/offset validation. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem with transparent, consensus-based performance evaluation.

## Architecture Overview

The Observer Protocol operates through a systematic process where selected gateways monitor their peers and report findings to maintain network quality:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SC as AR.IO Smart Contract
    participant OBS as Observer Gateway
    participant GW as Target Gateway
    participant AR as Arweave Network

    Note over SC,AR: Epoch Start
    SC->>SC: Select up to 50 observers(weighted random)
    SC->>SC: Generate 2 prescribed ArNS names
    SC->>OBS: Notify selection & provide names

    Note over SC,AR: Observation Phase
    OBS->>OBS: Choose 8 additional ArNS names
    OBS->>OBS: Select subset for chunk validation
    loop For each gateway to test
        OBS->>GW: Test ArNS resolution (10 names)
        GW-->>OBS: Response data
        OBS->>OBS: Score: Pass/Fail
    end
    loop For selected gateways
        OBS->>GW: Test chunk/offset validation
        GW-->>OBS: Chunk data + Merkle proof
        OBS->>OBS: Verify cryptographic proof
    end

    Note over SC,AR: Reporting Phase
    OBS->>AR: Upload detailed JSON report
    AR-->>OBS: Confirm storage
    OBS->>SC: Submit failed gateways list
    SC-->>OBS: Confirm interaction

    Note over SC,AR: Evaluation & Rewards
    SC->>SC: Tally all observer votes
    SC->>SC: Determine gateway status(≥50% pass = functional)
    SC->>SC: Calculate reward distribution
    SC->>OBS: Distribute observer rewards
    SC->>GW: Distribute gateway rewards(if functional)
```

## Epoch Cycle and Responsibilities

Each 24-hour epoch follows a structured process with specific responsibilities for gateways and observers:

### Epoch Start

- **Smart Contract**: Selects up to 50 observers using weighted random selection
- **Smart Contract**: Generates 2 prescribed ArNS names for all observers to test
- **Selected Observers**: Receive notification of selection and prescribed names

### Observation Phase

- **Observers**: Choose 8 additional ArNS names to test (total of 10 names per gateway)
- **Observers**: Select subset of gateways for chunk/offset validation based on sampling rate
- **Observers**: Test assigned gateways for ArNS resolution, wallet ownership, content hashes, and response times
- **Observers**: Validate chunk/offset data integrity using cryptographic Merkle proofs
- **Target Gateways**: Respond to resolution requests, serve content, and provide chunk data with proofs

### Reporting Phase

- **Observers**: Upload detailed JSON reports to Arweave for transparency
- **Observers**: Submit failed gateway lists to the AR.IO Smart Contract for consensus voting

### Evaluation and Distribution

- **Smart Contract**: Tallies all observer votes (≥50% pass = functional gateway)
- **Smart Contract**: Distributes rewards at epoch end based on performance
- **Functional Gateways/Observers**: Receive ARIO token rewards automatically

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Monitoring**: Peer-to-peer evaluation ensures no single point of failure
- **Consensus-Based Scoring**: Majority rule (≥50% pass votes) determines gateway functionality
- **Performance Incentives**: Only functional gateways and observers receive ARIO token rewards
- **Data Integrity Validation**: Cryptographic verification of chunk/offset data using Merkle proofs
- **Transparent Accountability**: All reports permanently stored on Arweave and viewable at [gateways.ar.io](https://gateways.ar.io)
- **Sustainable Funding**: Protocol balance funded by ArNS name purchases, aligning rewards with network usage

## Chunk/Offset Validation

The protocol includes advanced data integrity verification through chunk/offset observation. Observers validate that gateways can correctly serve and verify Arweave data chunks using cryptographic proofs:

### Validation Process

- **Sampling**: A subset of gateways is selected for chunk validation each epoch
- **Offset Testing**: Random offsets within the stable weave range are tested
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Cryptographic validation ensures chunk authenticity
- **Binary Search Optimization**: Efficient transaction lookup using cached metadata

### Technical Implementation

- **Chunk Retrieval**: `GET /chunk/{offset}` returns chunk data and Merkle proof
- **Proof Validation**: Uses Arweave's `validatePath()` function for cryptographic verification
- **Performance Optimization**: LRU caching for blocks, transactions, and metadata
- **Early Stopping**: Tests stop immediately upon first successful validation

# Observer Selection (/learn/oip/observer-selection)

## Epochs and Selection Timeline

The AR.IO network operates on **24-hour epochs**, during which the observer selection and evaluation process takes place. At the start of each epoch:

- **50 observers** are selected to monitor the network
- **2 prescribed ArNS names** are chosen for all observers to test
- **8 additional names** are selected by each observer individually
- **Gateway subset** is selected for chunk/offset validation based on sampling rate

This creates a consistent evaluation framework where all observers test the same baseline names while having flexibility to choose additional targets for comprehensive network monitoring, plus advanced data integrity verification.

## Selection Process

Up to **fifty (50)** gateways are selected as observers per epoch using a sophisticated weighted random selection system. The selection uses **hashchain entropy** from previous AR.IO contract state messages to ensure unpredictable and tamper-resistant selection.

The hashchain-based entropy provides cryptographic randomness for selecting:

- **Observer Gateways**: The 50 gateways chosen to perform observations
- **Prescribed ArNS Names**: The 2 common names all observers must evaluate

This approach prevents manipulation while maintaining weighted probabilities based on gateway performance and commitment.

![Current epoch observers showing their observation chance (normalized composite weight) and report status](/observers.png)

    gateways.ar.io/#/observers
  {" "}
  shows the current epoch prescribed observers and arns names, as well as their
  submission status

## Weighted Selection Criteria

Observer selection is based on **normalized composite weights** that combine multiple performance and commitment factors. These weights determine each gateway's probability of being selected as an observer for the epoch.

The selection considers four key factors that are multiplied together to create a composite weight (CW):

- **Stake Weight (SW)**: Financial commitment to the network
- **Tenure Weight (TW)**: Length of network participation
- **Gateway Performance Ratio Weight (GPRW)**: Historical gateway performance
- **Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)**: Historical observer performance

These weights are then normalized across all eligible gateways to create selection probabilities. For detailed weight calculations and formulas, see [Performance Evaluation](/learn/oip/performance-evaluation).

## Hashchain Random Selection

The selection process uses **hashchain entropy** from previous AR.IO contract state messages to achieve cryptographically secure randomness:

### How Hashchain Selection Works

1. **Entropy Source**: Random numbers are generated from the hashchain of previous contract state messages
2. **Weighted Mapping**: Each random number maps to normalized weight ranges of eligible gateways
3. **Observer Selection**: The gateway whose weight range contains each random number is selected
4. **Prescribed Names**: The same entropy selects 2 ArNS names that all observers must test

This creates tamper-resistant selection where higher-weighted gateways have proportionally better chances of selection, while maintaining true randomness that cannot be predicted or manipulated.

## Chunk/Offset Sampling

In addition to observer selection, the protocol includes a separate sampling process for chunk/offset validation:

### Gateway Selection for Chunk Validation

- **Deterministic Selection**: Uses PRNG seeded with observation entropy to select gateway subset
- **Sampling Rate**: Configurable percentage of gateways tested per observation (default: 1%)
- **Minimum Guarantee**: At least 1 gateway is always selected for testing
- **Offset Selection**: Random offsets within the stable weave range are chosen for each selected gateway

  **Initial Implementation**: During the initial rollout phase, only a very
  small portion of gateways will be checked for chunk/offset validation, and the
  current validation criteria are extremely lenient to ensure smooth network
  operation.

### Validation Process

- **Chunk Retrieval**: Observers request chunk data using `GET /chunk/{offset}`
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Cryptographic validation ensures data integrity
- **Early Stopping**: Tests stop immediately upon first successful validation
- **Performance Optimization**: Uses LRU caching for efficient transaction lookup

## Fairness and Meritocracy

This system ensures:

- **Meritocratic Selection**: Higher-performing gateways have better selection odds
- **Fair Opportunity**: All gateways maintain non-zero selection probability
- **Tamper Resistance**: Hashchain entropy prevents manipulation
- **Consistent Standards**: Prescribed names create common evaluation baseline

The selection is saved in the contract state at epoch start to ensure that activities during the epoch do not affect selection or reward distribution.

## Next Steps

Ready to understand how performance is evaluated? Learn about [Performance Evaluation](/learn/oip/performance-evaluation) to see how gateways are scored, or explore [Reward Distribution](/learn/oip/reward-distribution) to understand how rewards are calculated and distributed.

# Performance and Weights (/learn/oip/performance-evaluation)

## Gateway Classifications

Consider the following classifications:

- **Functional or Passed Gateways**: are gateways that meet or surpass the network's performance and quality standards, including ArNS resolution and chunk/offset validation (if selected).
- **Deficient or Failed Gateways**: are gateways that fall short of the network's performance expectations, including failures in ArNS resolution or chunk/offset validation.
- **Functional or Submitted Observers**: are selected observers who diligently perform their duties and submit observation reports and contract interactions.
- **Deficient or Failed Observers**: are selected observers who do not fulfill their duty of submitting observation reports and contract interactions.

## Evaluation Process

At the end of an epoch, the AR.IO Smart Contract processes observer submissions to determine gateway performance through a consensus-based vote tallying system. This evaluation transforms individual observer reports into network-wide performance assessments.

### Vote Tallying and Gateway Classification

After observers submit their detailed reports (see [Reporting](/learn/oip/reporting) for submission details), the smart contract performs consensus calculation:

**Vote Processing:**

- **Data Collection**: All observer contract interactions for each gateway are collected
- **Vote Counting**: Each observer submission contributes either a PASS or FAIL vote
- **Majority Determination**: If ≥50% of submitted observer interactions indicate PASS, the gateway is considered Functional
- **Binary Classification**: Gateways are classified as either Functional (eligible for rewards) or Deficient (ineligible for rewards)

**Consensus Mechanism:**

- Multiple observers evaluate each gateway independently, ensuring reliable assessment
- The 50% threshold requires majority agreement for positive performance determination
- Binary scoring provides clear, unambiguous performance classification
- Vote tallying occurs after the 40-minute confirmation period to ensure all interactions are finalized

## Chunk/Offset Validation Criteria

For gateways selected for chunk/offset validation, additional performance criteria are evaluated:

### Validation Requirements

- **Chunk Retrieval**: Gateway must successfully respond to `GET /chunk/{offset}` requests
- **Data Integrity**: Chunk data must be non-empty and within reasonable size limits (&lt;1MB)
- **Merkle Proof Validation**: Cryptographic proof must decode correctly and validate against transaction data_root
- **Performance Standards**: Response times must meet network expectations

  **Initial Implementation**: During the initial rollout phase, only a very
  small portion of gateways will be checked for chunk/offset validation, and the
  current validation criteria are extremely lenient to ensure smooth network
  operation.

### Assessment Process

- **Binary Scoring**: Each offset test results in pass/fail determination
- **Consensus Integration**: Chunk/offset results are integrated into overall gateway assessment
- **Performance Tracking**: Individual offset assessments are tracked and reported

## Weight Impact on Gateway Performance

Gateway performance directly affects multiple weighted factors that influence future observer selection and overall network participation:

### Gateway Performance Ratio Weight (GPRW)

A gateway's evaluation results directly impact their Gateway Performance Ratio Weight, which affects their likelihood of being selected as an observer in future epochs:

```math
GPRW = \frac{1 + \text{Passed Epochs}}{1 + \text{Participated Epochs}}
```

**Impact:**

- **Functional Gateways**: Increase their passed epochs count, improving their GPRW
- **Deficient Gateways**: Decrease their GPRW as participated epochs increase without corresponding passes
- **Observer Selection**: Higher GPRW increases chances of being selected as an observer

### Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)

For gateways selected as observers, their performance in submitting reports affects future selection:

```math
OPRW = \frac{1 + \text{Submitted Epochs}}{1 + \text{Selected Epochs}}
```

**Impact:**

- **Functional Observers**: Who submit reports increase their OPRW
- **Deficient Observers**: Who fail to submit reports see their OPRW decrease
- **Future Selection**: Higher OPRW improves chances of future observer selection

### Composite Weight Calculation

All performance factors combine to determine overall network influence:

```math
CW = SW \times TW \times GPRW \times OPRW
```

Where:

- **SW** = Stake Weight (financial commitment)
- **TW** = Tenure Weight (network longevity)
- **GPRW** = Gateway Performance Ratio Weight
- **OPRW** = Observer Performance Ratio Weight

**Long-term Effects:**

- Consistently functional gateways accumulate higher composite weights
- Poor performers see diminishing influence and selection chances
- Performance history creates compounding effects on network participation

## Evaluation Timeline

Rewards are distributed **at the end of each epoch** by the AR.IO Smart Contract directly based on the tallied observer votes. The smart contract processes all observer submissions and automatically distributes rewards to functional gateways and observers based on their performance during the epoch.

## Key Features

- **Majority Rule**: Gateway performance is determined by majority vote from observers
- **Binary Scoring**: Simple pass/fail system for clear performance assessment
- **Network Confirmation**: Delay ensures all votes are confirmed before evaluation
- **Transparent Process**: All evaluations are based on onchain data

## Consequences of Performance

### Functional Gateways

- Eligible for gateway rewards
- Maintain good standing in the network
- Continue to be considered for observer selection

### Deficient Gateways

- Ineligible for gateway rewards
- Risk being marked as deficient for multiple epochs
- May face additional penalties for prolonged poor performance

### Observer Performance

- Functional observers receive observer rewards
- Deficient observers forfeit observer rewards
- Deficient observers who are also functional gateways have their gateway reward reduced by 25%

# Reporting (/learn/oip/reporting)

## Observer Responsibilities

Selected observers have specific duties each epoch: test gateways, document results, and submit findings through two channels. Proper completion of these responsibilities determines observer rewards and future selection chances.

## Dual Submission Process

Observers must submit their findings through both channels to fulfill their duties:

### 1. Detailed Reports to Arweave

- **Format**: Comprehensive JSON reports with full evaluation data
- **Purpose**: Permanent audit trail and transparency
- **Content**: Complete test results, timing data, and failure details

### 2. Contract Interactions to AR.IO Smart Contract

- **Format**: List of failed gateways
- **Purpose**: Efficient vote tallying for consensus
- **Content**: Binary pass/fail determinations for each gateway tested

## Observer Evaluations

Observers test assigned gateways against 10 ArNS names (2 prescribed + 8 chosen) and document their findings:

![Observer Report Overview showing multiple gateway evaluations](/observer-report.png)

### Evaluation Results

      Passing Report: Gateway successfully resolves ArNS names
      with correct status codes (200), transaction IDs, and data hashes.

      Failing Report: Gateway fails ArNS resolution tests due
      to ownership issues, timeouts (5000ms), or missing content.

Observers evaluate gateways based on:

- **Gateway Wallet Ownership**: Verifies correct wallet address
- **ArNS Resolution**: Tests successful name-to-transaction resolution
- **Content Hash Verification**: Ensures data integrity
- **Response Times**: Measures performance within limits
- **Chunk/Offset Validation**: Cryptographic verification of data chunks (for selected gateways)

## Chunk/Offset Assessment Reporting

For gateways selected for chunk/offset validation, observers perform additional testing and reporting:

### Validation Process

- **Offset Selection**: Random offsets within the stable weave range are chosen for testing
- **Chunk Retrieval**: Observers request chunk data using `GET /chunk/{offset}` endpoint
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Cryptographic validation ensures chunk authenticity
- **Binary Search**: Efficient transaction lookup using cached metadata for proof validation

### Reporting Details

- **Individual Assessments**: Each offset test is tracked with pass/fail/skipped status
- **Enforcement Status**: Reports include whether chunk/offset failures affect gateway status
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and validation results are documented
- **Early Stopping**: Tests stop immediately upon first successful validation

### Report Structure

```json
{
  "offsetAssessments": {
    "plannedOffsets": [12345, 67890, ...],
    "actualAssessments": [...],
    "validatedOffset": 12345,
    "pass": true,
    "enforcementEnabled": true
  }
}
```

  **Initial Implementation**: During the initial rollout phase, only a very
  small portion of gateways will be checked for chunk/offset validation, and the
  current validation criteria are extremely lenient to ensure smooth network
  operation.

## Observer Rewards and Penalties

Observer performance directly impacts rewards and future participation:

### Successful Observer Performance

- **Observer Reward**: Observers who submit both reports and contract interactions receive the Observer Reward
- **Future Selection**: Successful reporting improves Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)
- **Increased Chances**: Higher OPRW increases likelihood of future observer selection and more reward opportunities

### Failed Observer Performance

- **No Observer Reward**: Observers who fail to submit required reports forfeit their Observer Reward
- **Gateway Penalty**: If the deficient observer is also a functional gateway, their gateway reward is **reduced by 25%**
- **Reduced Selection**: Failed submissions decrease OPRW, diminishing future observer selection chances
- **Lost Opportunities**: Lower selection probability means fewer chances to earn Observer Rewards

## Observer Accountability

The system tracks observer performance to ensure network quality:

- **Submission Tracking**: Both Arweave reports and contract interactions must be submitted
- **Performance History**: Observer submission record affects future selection probability
- **Reward Impact**: Consistent reporting builds credibility and increases earning potential

## Next Steps

Ready to understand how these reports are processed? Learn about [Performance Evaluation](/learn/oip/performance-evaluation) to see how reports become votes and determine gateway rewards, or explore [Reward Distribution](/learn/oip/reward-distribution) to understand the complete incentive structure.

# Distributions (/learn/oip/reward-distribution)

## Protocol Balance and Funding

The AR.IO network maintains a protocol balance that funds all gateway and observer rewards. This balance is primarily funded through ArNS name purchases, ensuring sustainable network incentives aligned with usage.

## Epoch Allocation

Each epoch, a portion of the protocol balance is earmarked for distribution as rewards. This value shall begin at 0.1% per epoch for the first year of operation, then linearly decline down to and stabilize at 0.05% over the following 6 months.

### Funding Sources
- **ArNS Name Purchases**: Primary funding mechanism - fees from ArNS name registrations and renewals
- **Network Genesis Allocation**: Initial ARIO tokens allocated at network launch
- **Undistributed Rewards**: Rewards not claimed due to poor performance roll forward to future epochs

From this allocation, two distinct reward categories are derived:

## Base Rewards

### Base Gateway Reward (BGR)

This is the portion of the reward allocated to each Functional Gateway within the network and is calculated as:

```math
BGR = \frac{\text{Epoch Reward Allocation} \times 0.9}{\text{Total Gateways in the Network}}
```

### Base Observer Reward (BOR)

Observers, due to their additional responsibilities, have a separate reward calculated as:

```math
BOR = \frac{\text{Epoch Reward Allocation} \times 0.1}{\text{Total Selected Observers for the Epoch}}
```

## Distribution Based on Performance

The reward distribution is contingent on the performance classifications derived from the Performance Evaluation:

- **Functional Gateways**: Gateways that meet the performance criteria receive the Base Gateway Reward.
- **Deficient Gateways**: Gateways falling short in performance do not receive any gateway rewards.
- **Functional Observers**: Observers that fulfilled their duty receive the Base Observer Reward.
- **Deficient Observers**: Observers failing to meet their responsibilities do not receive observer rewards. Furthermore, if they are also Functional Gateways, their gateway reward is reduced by **25%** for that epoch as a consequence for not performing their observation duty.

![Epoch reward distributions showing eligible vs distributed ARIO tokens](/epoch-distributions.png)

  Epoch reward distributions showing the relationship between eligible rewards (total available) and distributed rewards (actually paid out) across epochs. The difference represents rewards not distributed due to gateway or observer deficiencies.

## Auto-Staking

Gateways shall be given the option to have their reward tokens "auto-staked" to their existing stake or sent to their wallet as unlocked tokens. The default setting shall be "auto-staked".

## Distribution to Delegates

The protocol will automatically distribute a Functional Gateway's shared rewards with its delegates. The distribution will consider the gateway's total reward for the period (including observation rewards), the gateway's "Delegate Reward Share Ratio", and each delegate's stake proportional to the total delegation.

Each individual delegate reward is calculated as:

```math
DR_i = \text{Total Rewards} \times \text{Reward Share Ratio} \times \frac{\text{Delegate's Stake}}{\text{Total Delegated Stake}}
```

Unlike gateways, token reward distributions to delegated stakers will only be "auto-staked" in that they will be automatically added to the delegate's existing stake associated with the rewarded gateway. The delegated staker is then free to withdraw their staked rewards at any time (subject to withdrawal delays).

## Undistributed Rewards

In cases where rewards are not distributed, either due to the inactivity or deficiency of gateways or observers, the allocated tokens shall remain in the protocol balance and carry forward to the next epoch.

This mechanism is in place to discourage observers from frivolously marking their peers as offline in hopes of attaining a higher portion of the reward pool.

Note that if a gateway (and its delegates) leaves the network or a delegate fully withdraws stake from a gateway, they become ineligible to receive rewards within the corresponding epoch and the earmarked rewards will not be distributed.

## Handling Deficient Gateways

To maintain network efficiency and reduce contract state bloat, gateways that are marked as deficient, and thus fail to receive rewards, for **thirty (30)** consecutive epochs will automatically trigger a "Network Leave" action and be subject to the associated stake withdrawal durations for both gateway stake and any delegated stake.

In addition, the gateway shall have its **minimum network-join stake slashed by 100%**. The slashed stake shall be immediately sent to the protocol balance.

# Token (/learn/token)

## Overview

ARIO is the multifunction [AO Computer](/glossary) based token that powers the AR.IO Network and its suite of permanent cloud applications. Built on AO, ARIO leverages the computational power and permanence of the Arweave ecosystem to create a robust, decentralized infrastructure token.

### Key Features

- **Native AO Token**: ARIO is built directly on AO Computer, utilizing its decentralized compute capabilities for smart contract execution and network operations
- **Staking-Based Infrastructure**: The network operates on a staking-based incentive system where gateway operators secure infrastructure services through token commitment
- **Multi-utility Design**: ARIO serves multiple functions within the ecosystem, from network participation to governance and payments

## Incentive Mechanisms

ARIO's design creates powerful incentives for network participants through multiple reward streams:

### Gateway Operator Incentives

- **Staking Rewards**: Gateway operators earn rewards for maintaining network infrastructure and providing reliable data services
- **Performance Bonuses**: Additional rewards for gateways that demonstrate high uptime and fast response times
- **Network Growth Rewards**: Operators benefit as the network scales and generates more activity

### Delegator Rewards

- **Delegated Staking**: Token holders can delegate their ARIO to trusted gateway operators to participate in network operations
- **Increased Operator Stake**: Delegation enhances gateway operator visibility and influence within the network
- **Shared Risk and Rewards**: Delegators participate in the risk and rewards of gateway operations
- **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Delegated tokens can be withdrawn following the same vault lock period rules

### Ecosystem Participation

- **ArNS Revenue Sharing**: Name registration fees flow back to network participants through the reward distribution mechanism
- **Protocol Growth**: As network usage increases, token utility and value proposition strengthen
- **Community Incentives**: Active participation in governance and ecosystem development is rewarded

## Staking Architecture

The AR.IO Network implements a robust staking-based incentive system that ensures infrastructure reliability and network participation:

### Gateway Operator Requirements

- Gateway operators must stake a minimum amount of ARIO tokens to join the network
- Staking demonstrates commitment to network objectives and promotes infrastructure reliability
- Only gateways that pass [Observation and Incentive Protocol](/learn/oip) evaluations receive rewards
- Staked tokens remain locked until withdrawal is initiated or vault period expires

### Network Quality Assurance

- **Non-Inflationary Design**: Fixed supply of 1 billion ARIO tokens with no minting mechanism
- **Immutable Protocol**: No governance control or special write access for upgrades
- **Infrastructure Focus**: Staking secures gateway infrastructure for permanent cloud services
- **Peer Monitoring**: Gateways serve as observers, testing and evaluating each other's performance

### Economic Incentives

- Gateway operators earn rewards only when they pass observation evaluations (≥50% consensus)
- Staking creates opportunity cost that aligns operator incentives with network health
- Observer gateways receive additional rewards for monitoring network quality
- Delegated staking allows broader community participation in successful gateway operations

## Built on AO Computer

ARIO's foundation on AO Computer provides unique advantages:

# Staking (/learn/token/staking)

## Overview

Staking tokens within the AR.IO Network serves a dual primary purpose: it signifies a public commitment by gateway operators and qualifies them and their delegates for reward distributions.

In the AR.IO ecosystem, "staking" refers to the process of locking a specified amount of ARIO tokens into a protocol-controlled vault. This act signifies an opportunity cost for the staker, acting both as a motivator and a public pledge to uphold the network's collective interests. Once staked, tokens remain locked until the staker initiates an 'unstake / withdraw' action or reaches the end of the vault’s lock period.

It is important to note that the ARIO Token is non-inflationary, distinguishing the AR.IO Network's staking mechanism from yield-generation tools found in other protocols. Staking in this context is about eligibility for potential rewards rather than direct token yield. By staking tokens, gateway operators (and their delegates) demonstrate their commitment to the network, thereby gaining eligibility for protocol-driven rewards and access to the network’s shared resources.

## Gateway Staking

A gateway operator must stake tokens to join their gateway to the network, which not only makes them eligible for protocol rewards but also promotes network reliability. This staking requirement reassures users and developers of the gateway's commitment to the network’s objectives, and gateways that adhere to or surpass network performance standards become eligible for these rewards. Gateway operators may increase their stake above the minimum, known as excess stake. A gateway’s total stake is impacted the following epoch once excess stake is added or removed.

## Delegated Staking

To promote participation from a wider audience, the network allows anyone with available ARIO tokens to partake in delegated staking. Users can choose to take part in the risk and rewards of gateway operations by staking their tokens with an active gateway (or multiple gateways) through an act known as delegating.

      Delegators can select which gateways to stake with in gateways.ar.io - maximize their potential rewards based on operator performance, stakes, and weights

### How Delegated Staking Works

**Delegated staking allows you to participate in the AR.IO Network's reward system without running your own gateway.** By staking your ARIO tokens on existing gateways, you can earn rewards while supporting network infrastructure.

When you delegate stake to a gateway, you're essentially lending your tokens to increase that gateway's total stake. This increases the gateway's chances of being selected as an observer, which means more potential rewards for both the gateway operator and you as a delegator.

### Benefits

- **Passive Income**: Earn rewards without running infrastructure
- **Network Participation**: Support the AR.IO Network's growth
- **Flexibility**: Redelegate to different gateways as conditions change
- **Low Barrier to Entry**: No technical expertise required
- **Transparent Rewards**: Clear visibility into reward distribution

### Getting Started

**Get ARIO Tokens**

You'll need ARIO tokens to delegate. See our comprehensive guide on [How to Get ARIO Tokens](/learn/token/get-the-token) for detailed information about acquiring tokens through exchanges, swaps, and network participation.

**Choose a Gateway**

Research gateways on the [Gateway Portal](https://gateways.ar.io/#/staking) to find one that matches your preferences for reward sharing and performance. Look for gateways with strong uptime, competitive reward sharing percentages, and reliable operation history.

**Delegate Your Stake**

Use the [Gateway Portal](https://gateways.ar.io/#/staking) to delegate your tokens. The process is straightforward and your tokens remain secure throughout.

**Monitor Your Rewards**

Track your delegation performance and rewards through the portal's dashboard. Receive your share of the gateway's rewards based on the percentage set by the gateway operator.

### Important Considerations

- **Gateway Performance**: Your rewards depend on the gateway's performance and observer selection
- **Reward Sharing**: Gateway operators set the percentage of rewards shared with delegators
- **Redelegation**: You can move your stake between gateways as network conditions change
- **Withdrawal Delays**: There may be delays when withdrawing your delegated stake

## Stake Redelegation

This feature enables existing stakers to reallocate their staked tokens between gateways, known as redelegation. Both delegated stakers and gateway operators with excess stake (stake above the minimum network-join requirement) can take advantage of this feature. Redelegation is intended to offer users flexibility and the ability to respond to changing network conditions.

## Redeeming Delegated Stake for ArNS

Staked tokens generally have restricted liquidity to maintain a healthy degree of stability in the network. However, an exception to these restrictions allows delegated stakers to use their staked tokens for specific ArNS-related services. By leveraging their staking rewards, delegates can further engage with ArNS, strengthening the name system’s utilization and impact across the network.

## Expedited Withdrawal Fees

Gateway operators and delegated stakers can shorten the standard withdrawal delay period after initiating a withdrawal (or being placed into an automatic withdrawal by protocol mechanisms); this action is subject to a dynamic fee. At any point during the delay, users can choose to expedite access to their pending withdrawal tokens by paying a fee to the protocol balance, calculated based on how much sooner they want to receive their funds. Once triggered, the tokens are returned immediately to the user’s wallet.

# Wayfinder Protocol (/learn/wayfinder)

## The Problem: Centralized Gateway Reliance

Today, most Arweave content is accessed through a single gateway: `arweave.net`. This creates a critical centralization risk:

- **Single point of failure** - If arweave.net goes down, content becomes inaccessible
- **Censorship vulnerability** - A single gateway can block or filter content
- **Performance bottlenecks** - All traffic flows through one gateway
- **No content verification** - Users must trust the gateway to serve authentic content

## What is Wayfinder?

The Wayfinder protocol solves these problems by enabling **decentralized access** to Arweave content through any gateway in the AR.IO network. It's a [URI scheme](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) that transforms centralized URLs like `https://arweave.net/txid` into decentralized `ar://` URLs that can be resolved by any participating gateway.

Key capabilities:
- **Multi-gateway routing** - Access content through any AR.IO gateway
- **Built-in verification** - Verify content authenticity regardless of which gateway serves it
- **Automatic failover** - If one gateway is down, requests route to another
- **User control** - Choose routing strategies based on speed, trust, or randomization

## How Wayfinder Works

The Wayfinder protocol consists of three core components that work together to resolve and serve Arweave content:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Centralized Access"
        U1[Users] --> AW[arweave.net]
        AW --> AR1[Arweave]
        style AW fill:#ffcccc,stroke:#ff0000,stroke-width:3px,color:#333
        style U1 fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333
        style AR1 fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333
    end
```

vs.

```mermaid

        WF --> G3[Gateway 3]
        WF --> GN[Gateway N]
        
        G1 --> AR2[Arweave]
        G2 --> AR2
        G3 --> AR2
        GN --> AR2
    end
    
    style U2 fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333
    style AR2 fill:#fff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333
    style WF fill:#b3d9ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:3px,color:#333
    style G1 fill:#b3d9ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333
    style G2 fill:#b3d9ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333

    style GN fill:#b3d9ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px,color:#333
```

Wayfinder enables:
1. **Decentralized Routing**: Select from multiple gateways instead of relying on arweave.net
2. **Redundant Retrieval**: If one gateway fails, automatically failover to another
3. **Trust-minimized Verification**: Verify content authenticity regardless of which gateway serves it

### Transaction ID Resolution

To access content tied to an Arweave Transaction ID (TxId), simply append the TxId to `ar://`:

```
ar://qI19W6spw-kzOGl4qUMNp2gwFH2EBfDXOFsjkcNyK9A
```

Inputting this into a WayFinder-equipped browser will route your request through the right AR.IO Gateway, translating it as per your `Routing Method` settings.

### ArNS Name Resolution

Fetching content via an Arweave Name System (ArNS) name is straightforward. Attach the ArNS name to `ar://`:

```
ar://good-morning
```

The Wayfinder protocol, along with the WayFinder App, discerns between TxIds and ArNS names. Once the suitable `https://` request is formulated, the chosen gateway translates the ArNS name based on the ArNS aoComputer contract.

## Why Decentralized Access Matters

### Resilience Against Censorship
With centralized gateways like arweave.net, content can be blocked or filtered at a single point. Wayfinder distributes access across multiple independent gateways, making censorship significantly more difficult.

### Always-Available Content
When arweave.net experiences downtime or congestion, all content becomes inaccessible. Wayfinder automatically routes around failed gateways, ensuring your content remains available.

### Trust Through Verification
Centralized gateways require blind trust - you can't verify if the content served matches what's stored on Arweave. Wayfinder includes built-in verification capabilities, allowing clients to cryptographically verify content authenticity from any gateway.

### Performance Through Competition
Multiple gateways create a competitive ecosystem where gateways optimize for speed and reliability. Users benefit from automatic routing to the fastest available gateway.

## Verification: Trust but Verify

Wayfinder supports content verification at multiple levels:

1. **Transaction verification** - Verify that content matches the requested transaction ID
2. **Data integrity checks** - Ensure content hasn't been tampered with during transmission
3. **Manifest validation** - For bundled content, verify all components are authentic
4. **ArNS resolution verification** - Confirm ArNS names resolve to the correct transaction IDs

This verification happens transparently, giving users confidence that they're receiving authentic Arweave content regardless of which gateway serves it.

# Integration (/learn/wayfinder/integration)

## Getting Started

**Get the Extension**

The easiest way to use Wayfinder is the [Wayfinder Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ario-wayfinder/hnhmeknhajanolcoihhkkaaimapnmgil?hl=en-US), available in the Chrome Web Store.

### Wayfinder Extension

The wayfinder-extension is a simple Chrome extension that supports the ar:// routing protocol and allows you to:

- **Navigate ar:// URLs directly** in your browser
- **Configure routing strategies** - Choose how requests are routed to gateways
- **Set verification preferences** - Control content verification levels
- **Monitor gateway performance** - See which gateways are serving your requests

No coding required - just install the extension and start browsing ar:// URLs!

## Developer Integration Options

For developers who want to integrate Wayfinder into their applications:

### Wayfinder Core

The [wayfinder-core](/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core) library is the core protocol implementation that accepts various configuration options for setting up Wayfinder. It provides:

- **Gateway selection strategies** - Choose how to route requests
- **Content verification** - Optionally verify content authenticity
- **Telemetry collection** - Understand performance vs arweave.net
- **Custom configurations** - Fine-tune behavior for your use case

### Wayfinder React

Web developers will likely be interested in [wayfinder-react](/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-react), which provides:

- **React Context Provider** - Easy integration with React apps
- **Custom hooks** - Simplified data fetching and state management
- **Component library** - Pre-built UI components for common patterns
- **TypeScript support** - Full type safety out of the box

## Common Integration Pattern: Preferred with Fallback

For most builds, teams use the "preferred with fallback" pattern. This routing strategy prioritizes your preferred gateway but automatically falls back to other gateways in the network if needed:

```typescript

const wayfinder = new createWayfinderClient({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  verification: 'hash',
  routing: 'preferred',
  preferredGateway: 'arweave.net',
});
```

This pattern ensures:
1. **Primary traffic** goes to your preferred gateway (one you run or are delegated to)
2. **Automatic failover** if your gateway can't serve the data
3. **Network resilience** by finding another gateway that can serve the content

For detailed routing strategy options, see the [routing strategies documentation](/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/preferredwithfallbackroutingstrategy).

## Verification: Optional but Encouraged

While verification is optional, it's strongly encouraged when fetching from gateways:

```typescript

const wayfinder = createWayfinderClient({
  //...other settings,
  verification: 'hash', // hash based verification
});
```

Verification ensures you're receiving authentic content regardless of which gateway serves it.

## Telemetry for Performance Insights

Enable telemetry to understand how Wayfinder performs relative to arweave.net:

```typescript

const wayfinder = createWayfinderClient({
  //...other settings,
  telemetry: {
      enabled: true,
      sampleRate: 0.1, // sample 10% of requests
      apiKey: 'your-api-key', // optional
      clientName: 'my-app',
      clientVersion: '1.0.0'
  }
});
```

This helps teams make data-driven decisions about gateway selection and optimization.

## React Integration Example

Here's a complete example using wayfinder-react:

```tsx
import { ARIO } from '@ar.io/sdk;

// Configure Wayfinder
const wayfinderConfig = {
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  }),
  routingSettings: {
    // use the fastest pinging strategy to select the fastest gateway for requests
    strategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
      timeoutMs: 1000,
    }),
  }
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: false
  }
};

// Wrap your app
function App() {
  return (

  );
}

// Use in components
function WayfinderImage({ txId }: { txId: string }) {
  const { resolvedUrl, isLoading, error } = useWayfinderUrl({ txId });

  if (error) {
    return Error resolving URL: {error.message};
  }

  if (isLoading) {
    return Resolving URL...;
  }

  return (
    
  );
}
```

# Use Cases (/learn/wayfinder/use-cases)

## Decentralized Web Hosting with Flexible Access

With Wayfinder, not only can websites be hosted on the Arweave network, but their accessibility is also enhanced. By using the Wayfinder Protocol, web developers can ensure that if a specific AR.IO Gateway is down, the content can still be accessed through another gateway, offering a more reliable and resilient user experience.

This is particularly valuable for:

- **Personal websites** that need to remain accessible
- **Documentation sites** that must be always available
- **Portfolio sites** for professionals and creators

## Digital Archives and Preservation with Enhanced Sharing

Digitally archiving public domain works, especially in light of events like ["banned books week"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMSCHXklULQ), becomes more efficient with Wayfinder. Historical institutions or enthusiasts can easily share specific Wayfinder links to documents or media.

Unlike hardcoded links which might break if a specific gateway goes offline, Wayfinder ensures that the content remains consistently accessible.

This is ideal for:

- **Historical documents** and public domain works
- **Academic research** and scholarly articles
- **Cultural preservation** projects
- **Legal documents** that need permanent access

## Media Sharing Platforms with Consistent Content Delivery

For platforms hosting user-generated content, the Wayfinder Protocol provides not just decentralized hosting but also a guarantee of content delivery. Even if a content piece becomes viral and one gateway gets congested, Wayfinder ensures that users can still access the content through another gateway, providing a seamless experience.

Perfect for:

- **Social media platforms** with user-generated content
- **Video sharing sites** with viral content
- **Image galleries** and art platforms
- **Podcast hosting** and audio content

## Decentralized Applications (DApps) with Reliable Front-End Accessibility

DApps, while benefiting from Arweave's permanent hosting, can further ensure their front-end remains consistently accessible to users by using Wayfinder. If a DApp's front-end is accessed frequently, causing strain on one gateway, Wayfinder can help ensure the load is distributed, and the DApp remains online and functional.

This is essential for:

- **DeFi applications** that need high availability
- **NFT marketplaces** with high traffic
- **Gaming platforms** with real-time requirements
- **Collaborative tools** and productivity apps

## Branded Content Access

Companies and individuals can brand their permaweb content, making it accessible through their domain, enhancing brand visibility and user trust. This is achieved through DNS TXT records that link domain names to Arweave content.

## Dynamic Content Updates

Domain owners can easily update what Permaweb content their `ar://` URL resolves to, which is ideal for frequently updated resources like documents, blogs, and application interfaces.

## Educational and Informational Resources

Educational institutions and information providers can make their resources permanently available on the permaweb, accessible through simple, memorable URLs.

# Husky (Developers Only) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/husky-developers-only)

We use husky 6.x to manage the git commit hooks that help to improve the quality of our commits. Please run:

```shell
yarn husky install
```

to enable git hooks for your local checkout. Without doing so, you risk committing non-compliant code to the repository.

# Install Yarn 3 (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/install-yarn-3)

Both the ArDrive CLI and ArDrive Core JS use Yarn 3 to manage dependencies and initiate workflows, so follow the [yarn installation instructions][yarn-install] in order to get the latest version. In most cases:

```shell
brew install yarn

npm install -g yarn
```

# Installing and Starting the CLI From Source (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/installing-and-starting-the-cli-from-source)

Now that your runtime and/or development environment is set up, to install the package simply run:

```shell
yarn && yarn build
```

And then start the CLI (always from the root of this repository):

```shell
yarn ardrive
```

For convenience in the **non-developer case**, you can install the CLI globally on your system by performing the following step:

```shell
yarn pack

npm install i -g /path/to/package.tgz

ardrive
```

# Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions (Developers Only) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/recommended-visual-studio-code-extensions-developers-only)

To ensure your environment is compatible, we also recommend the following VSCode extensions:

-   [ES-Lint][eslint-vscode]
-   [Editor-Config][editor-config-vscode]
-   [Prettier][prettier-vscode]
-   [ZipFS][zipfs-vscode]

# Using a custom ArDrive-Core-JS (Optional) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(build-and-run-from-source)/using-a-custom-ardrive-core-js-optional)

To test a with a custom version of the `ardrive-core-js` library on your local system, change the `"ardrive-core-js"` line in `package.json` to the root of your local `ardrive-core-js` repo:

```diff
- "ardrive-core-js": "1.0.0"
+ "ardrive-core-js": "../ardrive-core-js/"
```

# Dealing With Network Congestion (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/dealing-with-network-congestion)

Currently, Arweave blocks hold up to 1000 transactions per block. The "mempool", where pending transactions reside until they've been included into a block, will only hold a transaction for 50 blocks (~100-150 minutes) before it's discarded by the network resulting in no fees or data being transacted. During periods of network congestion (i.e. those where the mempool contains 1000 or more pending transactions), it may make sense to either:

a) wait for congestion to dissipate before attempting your transactions.

b) apply the fee boost multiplier to your transactions rewards with the --boost parameter during write operations in order to front-run some of the congestion.

#### Check for network congestion before uploading

```shell
ardrive get-mempool

ardrive get-mempool | jq 'length'
```

#### Front-run Congestion By Boosting Miner Rewards

```shell
ardrive upload-file --wallet-file /path/to/my/wallet.json --parent-folder-id "f0c58c11-430c-4383-8e54-4d864cc7e927" --local-path ./helloworld.txt --boost 1.5
```

#### Send AR Transactions From a Cold Wallet

The best cold wallet storage never exposes your seed phrase and/or private keys to the Internet or a compromised system interface. You can use the ArDrive CLI to facilitate cold storage and transfer of AR.

If you need a new cold AR wallet, generate one from an air-gapped machine capable of running the ArDrive CLI by following the instructions in the [Wallet Operations](#wallet-operations) section. Fund your cold wallet from whatever external sources you'd like. NOTE: Your cold wallet won't appear on chain until it has received AR.

The workflow to send the AR out from your cold wallet requires you to generate a signed transaction with your cold wallet on your air-gapped machine via the ArDrive CLI, and then to transfer the signed transaction (e.g. by a file on a clean thumb drive) to an Internet-connected machine and send the transaction to the network via the ArDrive CLI. You'll need two inputs from the Internet-connected machine:

- the last transaction sent OUT from the cold wallet (or an empty string if none has ever been sent out)
- the base fee for an Arweave transaction (i.e. a zero bye transaction). Note that this value could change if a sufficient amount of time passes between the time you fetch this value, create the transaction, and send the transaction.

To get the last transaction sent from your cold wallet, use the `last-tx` command and specify your wallet address e.g.:

```
ardrive last-tx -a \
```

To get the base transaction reward required for an AR transaction, use the `base-reward` function, optionally applying a reward boost multiple if you're looking to front-run network congestion:

```
ardrive base-reward --boost 1.5
```

Write down or securely copy the values you derived from the Internet-connected machine and run the following commands on the airgapped machine, piping the outputted signed transaction data to a file in the process, e.g. `sendme.json` (if that's your signed transaction transfer medium preference):

```
ardrive create-tx -w /path/to/wallet/file.json -d \ -a \ --last-tx \ --reward "\" > sendme.json
```

Transport your signed transaction to the Internet-connected machine and run the following command to send your transaction to the Arweave network:

```
ardrive send-tx -x /path/to/sendme.json
```

# Monitoring Transactions (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/monitoring-transactions)

Block time on Arweave is typically between 2-3 minutes in duration, so transactions can be mined within that time frame when [network congestion](#dealing-with-network-congestion) is low. Transactions, in the general case, proceed through the following set of states:

-   Pending: the transaction is waiting the "mempool" to be mined
-   Confirming: the transaction was mined on an Arweave Node, but has not yet been confirmed by at least 15 total nodes on the network
-   Confirmed: the transaction was mined on an Arweave Node and confirmed by at least 15 total nodes on the network
-   Not Found: the transaction is not available for any of the following reasons:
    -   Insufficient reward to join the mempool
    -   Insufficient reward to be mined within 50 blocks during a period of network congestion
    -   Transaction is transitioning between states
    -   Transaction ID is invalid

Monitor any Arweave transaction's status via its transaction ID by performing:

```shell
ardrive tx-status -t "ekSMckikdRJ8RGIkFa-X3xq3427tvM7J9adv8HP3Bzs"
```

Example output:

```shell
ekSMckikdRJ8RGIkFa-X3xq3427tvM7J9adv8HP3Bzs: Mined at block height 775810 with 22439 confirmations
```

```shell
watch -n 10 ardrive tx-status -t "ekSMckikdRJ8RGIkFa-X3xq3427tvM7J9adv8HP3Bzs"
```

# Persistent Caching of ArFS Entity Metadata (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/persistent-caching-of-arfs-entity-metadata)

To avoid redundant requests to the Arweave network for immutable ArFS entity metadata, a persistent file cache is created and maintained at:

```
Windows: /ardrive-caches/metadata
Non-Windows: /.ardrive/caches/metadata
```

The `XDG_CACHE_HOME` environment variable is honored, where applicable, and will be used in place of `os.homedir()` in the scenarios described above.

Metadata cache logging to stderr can be enabled by setting the `ARDRIVE_CACHE_LOG` environment variable to `1`.

Cache performance is UNDEFINED for multi-process scenarios, but is presumed to be generally usable.

The cache can be manually cleared safely at any time that any integrating app is not in operation.

# Using a Custom Arweave Gateway (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(other-utility-operations)/using-a-custom-arweave-gateway)

On each command that uses a gateway, it is possible to supply your own custom Arweave gateway using the flag `--gateway` or by setting an environment variable named `ARWEAVE_GATEWAY`.

For example, you could test out that your ArFS transactions are working as expected on a local test network such as [ArLocal] with this flow:

```shell
npx arlocal

curl http://localhost:1984/mint/{ your public wallet address }/99999999999999

ardrive create-drive --gateway http://127.0.0.1:1984 -w /path/to/wallet -n 'my-test-drive'

curl "$ARWEAVE_GATEWAY/mine"

ardrive upload-file -F { root folder id from create drive } -l /path/to/file -w /path/to/wallet

curl "$ARWEAVE_GATEWAY/mine"

ardrive list-drive -d { drive id from create drive }

ardrive download-file -f { file id from upload file }
```

# Git (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(prerequisites)/git)

Some of ArDrive's dependencies are transitively installed via Git. Install it, if necessary, and ensure that it's available within your terminal environment:

[Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# NVM (Optional - Recommended) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(prerequisites)/nvm-optional-recommended)

This project uses the Node Version Manager (NVM) and an `.nvmrc` file to lock the recommended Node version used by the latest version of `ardrive-core-js`.

**Note for Windows: We recommend using WSL for setting up NVM on Windows using the [instructions described here][wsl-install]**

Follow these steps to get NVM up and running on your system:

1. Install NVM using [these installation instructions][nvm-install].
2. Navigate to this project's root directory
3. Ensure that the correct version of Node is installed by performing: `nvm install`
4. Use the correct version of Node, by performing: `nvm use`

**IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU AVOID GENERATING WALLETS VIA SEED PHRASE WITH THE CLI USING ANY NODE VERSION OTHER THAN THE ONE SPECIFIED IN `.nvmrc`.**

# Creating Drives (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/creating-drives)

```shell
ardrive create-drive --wallet-file /path/to/my/wallet.json --drive-name "My Public Archive"

ardrive create-drive --wallet-file /path/to/my/wallet.json --drive-name "Teenage Love Poetry" -P
```

# List Drive Pipeline Examples (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/list-drive-pipeline-examples)

You can utilize `jq` and the list commands to reshape the commands' output data into useful forms and stats for many use cases. Here are a few examples:

```shell
ardrive list-drive -d a44482fd-592e-45fa-a08a-e526c31b87f1 | jq '.[] | select(.entityType == "file") | "https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/" + .entityId + "/view"'
```

Example output:

```shell
"https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/1337babe-f000-dead-beef-ffffffffffff/view"
"https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/cdbc9ddd-1cab-41d9-acbd-fd4328929de3/view"
"https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/f19bc712-b57a-4e0d-8e5c-b7f1786b34a1/view"
"https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/4f8e081b-42f2-442d-be41-57f6f906e1c8/view"
"https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/0e02d254-c853-4ff0-9b6e-c4d23d2a95f5/view"
"https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/c098b869-29d1-4a86-960f-a9e10433f0b0/view"

"https://app.ardrive.io/#/file/85fe488d-fcf7-48ca-9df8-2b39958bbf15/view"
...
```

```shell
ardrive list-drive -d 13c3c232-6687-4d11-8ac1-35284102c7db | jq ' map(select(.entityType == "file") | .size) | add'
```

```shell
ardrive list-drive -d 01ea6ba3-9e58-42e7-899d-622fd110211c | jq '[ .[] | select(.entityType == "file") ] | length'
```

# Listing Drives for an Address (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/listing-drives-for-an-address)

You can list all the drives associated with any Arweave wallet address, though the details of private drives will be obfuscated from you unless you provide the necessary decryption data.

```shell
ardrive list-all-drives -w /path/to/my/wallet.json -P

ardrive list-all-drives --address "HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k"
```

# Listing Every Entity in a Drive (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/listing-every-entity-in-a-drive)

Useful notes on listing the contents of drives:

- Listing a drive is effectively the same as listing its root folder.
- You can control the tree depth of the data returned.
- path, txPath, and entityIdPath properties on entities can provide useful handholds for other forms of data navigation

```shell
ardrive list-drive -d "c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50" -w /path/to/my/wallet.json -P

ardrive list-drive -d "c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50" -w /path/to/my/wallet.json -P --with-keys

ardrive list-drive -d "c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50" --max-depth 2
```

# Managing Drive Passwords (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/managing-drive-passwords)

The ArDrive CLI's private drive and folder functions all require either a drive password OR a drive key. Private file functions require either the drive password or the file key. **Keys and passwords are sensitive data, so manage the entry, display, storage, and transmission of them very carefully.**

Drive passwords are the most portable, and fundamental, encryption facet, so a few options are available during private drive operations for supplying them:

- Environment Variable
- STDIN
- Secure Prompt

#### Supplying Your Password: Environment Variable

```shell
read -rs TMP_ARDRIVE_PW
ardrive \ -w /path/to/wallet.json -P
```

#### Supplying Your Password: STDIN

# Understanding Drive and File Keys (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/understanding-drive-and-file-keys)

Private Drives achieve privacy via end-to-end encryption facilitated by hash-derived "Keys". Drive Keys encrypt/decrypt Drive and Folder data, and File Keys encrypt/decrypt File Data.

The relationships among your data and their keys is as follows:

- Drive Key = functionOf(Wallet Signature, Randomly Generated Drive ID, User-specified Drive Password)
- File Key = functionOf(Randomly Generated File ID, Drive Key)

When you create private entities, the returned JSON data from the ArDrive CLI will contain the keys needed to decrypt the encrypted representation of your entity that is now securely and permanently stored on the blockweave.

To derive the drive key again for a drive, perform the following:

```shell
ardrive get-drive-key -w /path/to/my/wallet.json -d "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885" -P
```

To derive the file key again for a file, perform the following:

```shell
ardrive get-file-key --file-id "bd2ce978-6ede-4b0d-8f79-2d7bc235a0e0" --drive-id "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885" --drive-key "yHdCjpCK3EcuhQcKNx2d/NN5ReEjoKfZVqKunlCnPEo"
```

# Understanding Drive Hierarchies (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-drives)/understanding-drive-hierarchies)

At the root of every data tree is a "Drive" entity. When a drive is created, a Root Folder is also created for it. The entity IDs for both are generated and returned when you create a new drive:

```shell
ardrive create-drive --wallet-file /path/to/my/wallet.json --drive-name "Teenage Love Poetry" |
tee created_drive.json |
jq '[.created[] | del(.metadataTxId, .entityName, .bundledIn)]'
[
    {
        "type": "drive",
        "entityId": "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885"
    }
    {
        "type": "folder",
        "entityId": "d1535126-fded-4990-809f-83a06f2a1118"
    }
]
```

The relationship between the drive and its root folder is clearly visible when retrieving the drive's info:

```shell
ardrive drive-info -d "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885"
| jq '{driveId, rootFolderId}'
{
    "driveId": "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885",
    "rootFolderId": "d1535126-fded-4990-809f-83a06f2a1118"
}

```

All file and folder entities in the drive will be anchored to it by a "Drive-ID" GQL Tag. And they'll each be anchored to a parent folder ID, tracked via the "Parent-Folder-ID" GQL tag, forming a tree structure whose base terminates at the Root Folder.

# Dry Run (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-entities)/dry-run)

An important feature of the ArDrive CLI is the `--dry-run` flag. On each command that would write an ArFS entity, there is the option to run it as a "dry run". This will run all of the steps and print the outputs of a regular ArFS write, but will skip sending the actual transaction:

```shell
ardrive \ \ --dry-run
```

This can be very useful for gathering price estimations or to confirm that you've copy-pasted your entity IDs correctly before committing to an upload.

# Uploading to Turbo (BETA) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-entities)/uploading-to-turbo-beta)

Users can optionally choose to send each ArFS entities created to [ArDrive Turbo][ardrive-turbo] using the `--turbo` flag. Instead of using AR from an Arweave wallet, you can use Turbo Credits or take advantage of free/discounted upload promotions.

```shell
ardrive \ \ --turbo
```

This flag will skip any balance check on the CLI side. Turbo will check a user's balance and accept/reject a data item at the time of upload. The `--turbo` flag by default will send your files to `upload.ardrive.io` to be bundled. To change the Turbo destination, users can use the `--turbo-url` flag.

# Download a Single file (BETA) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/download-a-single-file-beta)

By using the `download-file` command you can download a file on chain to a folder in your local storage specified by --local-path (or to your current working directory if not specified):

```shell
ardrive download-file -w /path/to/wallet.json --file-id "ff450770-a9cb-46a5-9234-89cbd9796610" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/
```

Specify a filename in the --local-path if you'd like to use a different name than the one that's used in your drive:

```shell
ardrive download-file -w /path/to/wallet.json --file-id "ff450770-a9cb-46a5-9234-89cbd9796610" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/my_pic.png
```

# Downloading a Drive (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/downloading-a-drive)

To download the whole drive you can use the `download-drive` command.

```shell
ardrive download-drive -d "c0c8ba1c-efc5-420d-a07c-a755dc67f6b2"
```

This is equivalent to running the `download-folder` command against the root folder of the drive.

# Downloading a Folder with Files (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/downloading-a-folder-with-files)

You can download a folder from ArDrive to your local machine with the `download-folder` command. In the following examples, assume that a folder with ID "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6" exists in your drive and is named "MyArDriveFolder".

```shell
ardrive download-folder -f "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6"
```

By specifying the `--local-path` option, you can choose the local parent folder into which the on-chain folder will be downloaded. When the parameter is omitted, its value defaults to the current working directory (i.e. `./`).

```shell
ardrive download-folder -f "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/
```

The `--max-depth` parameter lets you to choose a custom folder depth to download. When omitted, the entire subtree of the folder will be downloaded. In the following example, only the immediate children of the folder will be downloaded:

```shell
ardrive download-folder -f "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6" --max-depth 0
```

The behaviors of `--local-path` are similar to those of `cp` and `mv` in Unix systems, e.g.:

```shell
ardrive download-folder -f "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6" --local-path "/existing_folder"

ardrive download-folder -f "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6" --local-path "/existing_folder/MyArDriveFolder"

ardrive download-folder -f "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6" --local-path "/existing_folder/non_existent_folder"

ardrive download-folder -f "47f5bde9-61ba-49c7-b409-1aa4a9e250f6" --local-path "/non_existent_folder_1/non_existent_folder_2"
```

# Fetching the Metadata of a File Entity (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/fetching-the-metadata-of-a-file-entity)

Simply perform the file-info command to retrieve the metadata of a file:

```shell
ardrive file-info --file-id "e5ebc14c-5b2d-4462-8f59-7f4a62e7770f"
```

Example output:

```shell

    "appName": "ArDrive-Web",
    "appVersion": "0.1.0",
    "arFS": "0.11",
    "contentType": "application/json",

# IPFS CID Tagging (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/ipfs-cid-tagging)

Certain nodes on the Arweave network may be running the [IPFS+Arweave bridge](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-ipfs-persistence-for-the-interplanetary-file-system-9f12981c36c3). Tagging your file upload transaction with its IPFS v1 CID value in the 'IPFS-Add' tag may allow you to take advantage of this system. It can also be helpful for finding data on Arweave via GQL based on its CID. To include the CID tag on your **PUBLIC** file uploads, you may use the '--add-ipfs-tag' flag:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --add-ipfs-tag --local-path /path/to/file.txt  --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

# Moving Files (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/moving-files)

Files can be moved from one folder to another within the same drive. Moving a file is simply the process of uploading a new file metadata revision with an updated File ID  Parent Folder ID relationship. The following command will move a file from its current location in a public drive to a new parent folder in that drive:

```shell
ardrive move-file --file-id "e5ebc14c-5b2d-4462-8f59-7f4a62e7770f" --parent-folder-id "a2c8a0cb-0ca7-4dbb-8bf8-93f75f308e63"
```

# Name Conflict Resolution on Upload (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/name-conflict-resolution-on-upload)

By default, the `upload-file` command will use the upsert behavior if existing entities are encountered in the destination folder tree that would cause naming conflicts.

Expect the behaviors from the following table for each of these resolution settings:

| Source Type | Conflict at Dest | `skip` | `replace` | `upsert` (default) |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| File        | None             | Insert | Insert    | Insert             |
| File        | Matching File    | Skip   | Update    | Skip               |
| File        | Different File   | Skip   | Update    | Update             |
| File        | Folder           | Skip   | Fail      | Fail               |
| Folder      | None             | Insert | Insert    | Insert             |
| Folder      | File             | Skip   | Fail      | Fail               |
| Folder      | Folder           | Re-use | Re-use    | Re-use             |

The default upsert behavior will check the destination folder for a file with a conflicting name. If no conflicts are found, it will insert (upload) the file.

In the case that there is a FILE to FILE name conflict found, it will only update it if necessary. To determine if an update is necessary, upsert will compare the last modified dates of conflicting file and the file being uploaded. When they are matching, the upload will be skipped. Otherwise the file will be updated as a new revision.

To override the upsert behavior, use the `--replace` option to always make new revisions of a file or the `--skip` option to always skip the upload on name conflicts:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --replace --local-path /path/to/file.txt  --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

```shell
ardrive upload-file --skip --local-path /path/to/file.txt  --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

Alternatively, the upload-file commands now also supports the `--ask` conflict resolution option. This setting will always provide an interactive prompt on name conflicts that allows users to decide how to resolve each conflict found:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --ask --local-file-path /path/to/file.txt  --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json

Destination folder has a file to file name conflict!

File name: 2.png
File ID: efbc0370-b69f-44d9-812c-0d272b019027
This file has a DIFFERENT last modified date

Please select how to proceed:
 › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Replace as new file revision
    Upload with a different file name
    Skip this file upload
```

# Progress Logging of Transaction Uploads (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/progress-logging-of-transaction-uploads)

Progress logging of transaction uploads to stderr can be enabled by setting the `ARDRIVE_PROGRESS_LOG` environment variable to `1`:

```shell

# Rename a Single File (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/rename-a-single-file)

To rename an on-chain file you can make use of the `rename-file` command. The required parameters are the file ID and the new name, as well as the owner wallet or seed phrase.

```shell
ardrive rename-file --file-id "290a3f9a-37b2-4f0f-a899-6fac983833b3" --file-name "My custom file name.txt" --wallet-file "wallet.json"
```

# Retrying a Failed File Data Transaction (Public Unbundled Files Only) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/retrying-a-failed-file-data-transaction-public-unbundled-files-only)

Arweave data upload transactions are split into two phases: transaction posting and chunks uploading. Once the transaction post phase has been completed, you've effectively "paid" the network for storage of the data chunks that you'll send in the next stage.

If your system encounters an error while posting the transaction, you can retry posting the transaction for as long as your tx_anchor is valid ([learn more about tx_anchors here][tx_anchors]). You may retry and/or resume posting chunks at any time after your transaction has posted. The ArDrive CLI allows you to take advantage of this Arweave protocol capability.

Using the CLI, when the transaction post has succeeded but the chunk upload step fails, the data transaction's ID could be lost. There are a few options to recover this ID. If the failed transaction is the most recent one sent from a wallet, the transaction ID can be recovered with the `ardrive last-tx -w /path/to/wallet` command AFTER the transaction's headers have been mined (It can take 5-10 minutes for the tx-id to become available with the last-tx approach). Other options for finding the partially uploaded transaction's ID include:

-   Using an Arweave gateway GQL http endpoint to search for transactions that belong to the wallet. See this [Arweave GQL Guide][gql-guide] for more info.
-   Browse the recent transactions associated with the wallet via a block explorer tool like [ViewBlock][viewblock].

In order to re-seed the chunks for an unbundled ArFS data transaction, a user must have the data transaction ID, the original file data, and either a destination folder ID or a valid file ID for the file. Supply that information to the `retry-tx` command like so:

```shell
ardrive retry-tx --tx-id { Data Transaction ID } --parent-folder-id { Destination Folder ID }  --local-path /path/to/file  --wallet-file /path/to/wallet
```

**Note: Retry feature is currently only available for PUBLIC unbundled file transactions. It is also perfectly safe to mistakenly re-seed the chunks of a healthy transaction, the transaction will remain stable and the wallet balance will not be affected.**

# Understanding Bundled Transactions (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/understanding-bundled-transactions)

The ArDrive CLI currently uses two different methods for uploading transactions to the Arweave network: standard transactions and Direct to Network (D2N) bundled transactions. By default, the CLI will send a D2N bundled transaction for any action that would result in multiple transactions. This bundling functionality is currently used on the `upload-file` and `create-drive` commands.

D2N bundled transactions come with several benefits and implications:

-   Bundling saves AR and enhances ArFS reliability by sending associated ArFS transactions up as one atomic bundle.
-   Bundled transactions are treated as a single data transaction by the Arweave network, but can be presented as separate transactions by the Arweave Gateway once they have been "unbundled".
-   Un-bundling can take anywhere from a few minutes up to an hour. During that time, the files in the bundle will neither appear in list- commands nor be downloadable. Similarly, they will not appear in the web app after syncs until un-bundling is complete. **This can negatively affect the accuracy of upsert operations**, so it's best to wait before retrying bulk uploads.
-   Bundling reliability on the gateway side degrades once bundles reach either 500 data items (or ~250 files) or 500 MiB, so the CLI will create and upload multiple bundles as necessary, or will send files that are simply too large for reliable bundling as unbundled txs.

# Uploading a Custom Manifest (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-custom-manifest)

Using the custom content type feature, it is possible for users to upload their own custom manifests. The Arweave gateways use this special content type in order to identify an uploaded file as a manifest:

```shell
application/x.arweave-manifest+json
```

In addition to this content type, the manifest must also adhere to the [correct JSON structure](#manifest-json) of an Arweave manifest. A user can create their own manifest from scratch, or start by piping a generated manifest to a JSON file and editing it to their specifications:

```shell
ardrive create-manifest -w /path/to/wallet -f "6c312b3e-4778-4a18-8243-f2b346f5e7cb"  --dry-run | jq '{manifest}.manifest' > my-custom-manifest.json
```

After editing the generated manifest, simply perform an `upload-file` command with the custom Arweave manifest content type to any PUBLIC folder:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --content-type "application/x.arweave-manifest+json" --local-path my-custom-manifest.json --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

The returned `dataTxId` field on the created `file` entity will be the endpoint that the manifest can be found on Arweave, just as explained in the [manifest sections](#uploading-manifests) above:

```shell
https://arweave.net/{dataTxId}
https://arweave.net/{dataTxId}/custom-file-1
https://arweave.net/{dataTxId}/custom-file-2
```

# Uploading a Folder with Files (Bulk Upload) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-folder-with-files-bulk-upload)

Users can perform a bulk upload by using the upload-file command on a target folder. The command will reconstruct the folder hierarchy on local disk as ArFS folders on the permaweb and upload each file into their corresponding folders:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --local-path /path/to/folder --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

# Uploading a Non-Bundled Transaction (NOT RECOMMENDED) (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-non-bundled-transaction-not-recommended)

While not recommended, the CLI does provide the option to forcibly send all transactions as standard transactions rather than attempting to bundle them together. To do this, simply add the `--no-bundle` flag to the `upload-file` or `create-drive` command:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --no-bundle --local-path /path/to/file --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

# Uploading a Single File (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-a-single-file)

To upload a file, you'll need a parent folder id, the file to upload's file path, and the path to your wallet:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --local-path /path/to/file.txt  --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

Example output:

```shell
{
    "created": [
        {
            "type": "file",
            "entityName": "file.txt"
            "entityId": "6613395a-cf19-4420-846a-f88b7b765c05"

        "1zwdfZAIV8E26YjBs2ZQ4xjjP_1ewalvRgD_GyYw7f8": 42819829
    }
}
```

NOTE: To upload to the root of a drive, specify its root folder ID as the parent folder ID for the upload destination. You can retrieve it like so:

```shell
ardrive drive-info -d "c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50" | jq -r '.rootFolderId'
```

# Uploading Files with Custom MetaData (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-files-with-custom-metadata)

ArDrive CLI has the capability of attaching custom metadata to ArFS File and Folder MetaData Transactions during the `upload-file` command. This metadata can be applied to either the GQL tags on the MetaData Transaction and/or into the MetaData Transaction's Data JSON.

All custom metadata applied must ultimately adhere to the following JSON shapes:

```ts
// GQL Tags
type CustomMetaDataGqlTags = Record;

// Data JSON Fields
type CustomMetaDataJsonFields = Record;

    | string
    | number
    | boolean
    | null
    | { [member: string]: JsonSerializable }
    | JsonSerializable[];
```

e.g:

```shell
{ IPFS-Add: 'MY_HASH' }
{ 'Custom Name': ['Val 1', 'Val 2'] }
```

When the custom metadata is attached to the MetaData Transaction's GQL tags, they will become visible on any Arweave GQL gateway and also third party tools that read GQL data.

When these tags are added to the MetaData Transaction's Data JSON they can be read by downloading the JSON data directly from `https://arweave.net/METADATA_TX_ID`.

To add this custom metadata to your file metadata transactions, CLI users can pass custom metadata these parameters:

-   `--metadata-file path/to/json/schema`
-   `--metadata-json '{"key": "val", "key-2": true, "key-3": 420, "key-4": ["more", 1337]}'`
-   `--metadata-gql-tags "Tag-Name" "Tag Val"`

The `--metadata-file` will accept a file path to JSON file containing custom metadata:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --metadata-file path/to/metadata/json # ...
```

This JSON schema object must contain instructions on where to put this metadata with the `metaDataJson` and `metaDataGqlTags` keys. e.g:

```json
{
    "metaDataJson": {
        "Tag-Name": ["Value-1", "Value-2"]
    },
    "metaDataGqlTags": {
        "GQL Tag Name": "Tag Value"
    }
}
```

The `--metadata-gql-tags` parameter accepts an array of string values to be applied to the MetaData Tx GQL Tags. This method of CLI input does not support multiple tag values for a given tag name and the input must be an EVEN number of string values. (Known bug: String values starting with the `"-"` character are currently not supported. Use --metadata-file parameter instead.) e.g:

```shell
upload-file --metadata-gql-tags "Custom Tag Name" "Custom Value" # ...
```

And the `--metadata-json` parameter will accept a stringified JSON input. It will apply all declared JSON fields directly to the MetaData Tx's Data JSON. e.g:

```shell
 upload-file --metadata-json ' { "json field": "value", "another fields": false } ' # ...
```

Custom metadata applied to files and/or folders during the `upload-file` command will be read back through all existing read commands. e.g:

```shell
ardrive file-info -f 067c4008-9cbe-422e-b697-05442f73da2b

#### Applying Unique Custom MetaData During Bulk Workflows

With some custom scripting and the `--metadata-file` parameter, the ArDrive CLI can be used to apply custom metadata to each file individually in a bulk workflow. For example, if you choose a numbered file naming pattern you can make use of a `for` loop:

```shell
for i in {1..5}
do
ardrive upload-file -F f0c58c11-430c-4383-8e54-4d864cc7e927 --local-path "../uploads/test-file-$i.txt" -w "/path/to/wallet.json" --metadata-file "../custom/metadata-$i.json" --dry-run > "file-result-$i.json"
done
```

# Uploading From a Remote URL (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-from-a-remote-url)

You can upload a file from an existing url using the `--remote-path` flag. This must be used in conjunction with `--dest-file-name`.

You can use a custom content type using the `--content-type` flag, but if this isn't used the app will use the content type from the response header of the request for the remote data.

```shell
ardrive upload-file --remote-path "https://url/to/file" --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -d "example.jpg" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

# Uploading Manifests (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-manifests)

[Arweave Path Manifests][arweave-manifests] are are special `.json` files that instruct Arweave Gateways to map file data associated with specific, unique transaction IDs to customized, hosted paths relative to that of the manifest file itself. So if, for example, your manifest file had an arweave.net URL like:

```shell
https://arweave.net/{manifest tx id}
```

Then, all the mapped transactions and paths in the manifest file would be addressable at URLs like:

```shell
https://arweave.net/{manifest tx id}/foo.txt
https://arweave.net/{manifest tx id}/bar/baz.png
```

ArDrive supports the creation of these Arweave manifests using any of your PUBLIC folders. The generated manifest paths will be links to each of the file entities within the specified folder. The manifest file entity will be created at the root of the folder.

To create a manifest of an entire public drive, specify the root folder of that drive:

```shell
ardrive create-manifest -f "bc9af866-6421-40f1-ac89-202bddb5c487" -w "/path/to/wallet"
```

You can also create a manifest of a folder's file entities at a custom depth by using the `--max-depth` option:

```shell
ardrive create-manifest --max-depth 0  -f "867228d8-4413-4c0e-a499-e1decbf2ea38" -w "/path/to/wallet"
```

Creating a `.json` file of your manifest links output can be accomplished here with some `jq` parsing and piping to a file:

```shell
ardrive create-manifest -w /path/to/wallet -f "6c312b3e-4778-4a18-8243-f2b346f5e7cb"  | jq '{links}' > links.json
```

If you'd like to preview the contents of your manifest before uploading, you can perform a dry run and do some lightweight post processing to isolate the data:

```shell
ardrive create-manifest -w /path/to/wallet -f "6c312b3e-4778-4a18-8243-f2b346f5e7cb"  --dry-run | jq '{manifest}.manifest'
```

```json
{
    "manifest": "arweave/paths",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "index": {
        "path": "index.html"
    },
    "paths": {
        "hello_world.txt": {
            "id": "Y7GFF8r9y0MEU_oi1aZeD87vrmai97JdRQ2L0cbGJ68"
        },
        "index.html": {
            "id": "pELonjVebHyBsdxVymvxbGTmHD96v9PuuUXj8GUHGoY"
        }
    }
}
```

The manifest data transaction is tagged with a unique content-type, `application/x.arweave-manifest+json`, which tells the gateway to treat this file as a manifest. The manifest file itself is a `.json` file that holds the paths (the data transaction ids) to each file within the specified folder.

When your folder is later changed by adding files or updating them with new revisions, the original manifest will NOT be updated on its own. A manifest is a permanent record of your files in their current state.

However, creating a subsequent manifest with the same manifest name will create a new revision of that manifest in its new current state. Manifests follow the same name conflict resolution as outlined for files above (upsert by default).

#### Hosting a Webpage with Manifest

When creating a manifest, it is possible to host a webpage or web app. You can do this by creating a manifest on a folder that has an `index.html` file in its root.

Using generated build folders from popular frameworks works as well. One requirement here to note is that the `href=` paths from your generated `index.html` file must not have leading a `/`. This means that the manifest will not resolve a path of `/dist/index.js` but it will resolve `dist/index.js` or `./dist/index.js`.

As an example, here is a flow of creating a React app and hosting it with an ArDrive Manifest. First, generate a React app:

```shell
yarn create react-app my-app
```

Next, add this field to the generated `package.json` so that the paths will resolve correctly:

```json
"homepage": ".",
```

Then, create an optimized production build from within the app's directory:

```shell
yarn build
```

Now, we can create and upload that produced build folder on ArDrive to any of your existing ArFS folder entities:

```shell
ardrive upload-file -l "/build" -w "/path/to/wallet" --parent-folder-id "bc9af866-6421-40f1-ac89-202bddb5c487"
```

And finally, create the manifest using the generated Folder ID from the build folder creation:

```shell
ardrive create-manifest -f "41759f05-614d-45ad-846b-63f3767504a4" -w "/path/to/wallet"
```

In the return output, the top link will be a link to the deployed web app:

```shell
    "links": [
        "https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg",
        "https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg/asset-manifest.json",
        "https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg/favicon.ico",
        "https://arweave.net/0MK68J8TqGhaaOpPe713Zn0jdpczMt2NGS2CtRYiuAg/index.html",
        # ...
```

This is effectively hosting a web app with ArDrive. Check out the ArDrive Price Calculator React App hosted as an [ArDrive Manifest][example-manifest-webpage].

# Uploading Multiple Files (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-multiple-files)

To upload an arbitrary number of files or folders, pass a space-separated list of paths to `--local-paths`:

```shell
ardrive upload-file -w wallet.json -F "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885" --local-paths ./image.png ~/backups/ ../another_file.txt

ardrive upload-file -w wallet.json -F "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885" --local-paths ./*.json
```

# Uploading With a Custom Content Type (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-files)/uploading-with-a-custom-content-type)

Each file uploaded to the Arweave network receives a `"Content-Type"` GraphQL tag that contains the MIME type for the file. The gateway will use this content type to determine how to serve that file's data transaction at the `arweave.net/{data tx id}` endpoint.

By default, the CLI will attempt to derive this content type from the file extension of the provided file. In most cases, the content type that is derived will be correct and the gateway will properly serve the file.

The CLI also provides the option for users to upload files with a custom content type using the `--content-type` flag:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --content-type "application/json"  --local-path /path/to/file --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

It is currently possible to set this value to any given string, but the gateway will still only serve valid content types. Check out this list of commonly used MIME types to ensure you're providing a valid content type: [Common MIME types][mozilla-mime-types].

Note: In the case of multi-file uploads or recursive folder uploads, setting this `--content-type` flag will set the provided custom content type on EVERY file entity within a given upload.

# Creating Folders (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/creating-folders)

Creating folders manually is straightforward:

```shell
ardrive create-folder --parent-folder-id "63153bb3-2ca9-4d42-9106-0ce82e793321" --folder-name "My Awesome Folder" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

Example output:

```shell
{
    "created": [
        {
            "type": "folder",
            "metadataTxId": "AYFMBVmwqhbg9y5Fbj3Iasy5oxUqhauOW7PcS1sl4Dk",
            "entityId": "d1b7c514-fb12-4603-aad8-002cf63015d3",
            "key": "yHdCjpCKD2cuhQcKNx2d/XF5ReEjoKfZVqKunlCnPEk",
            "entityName": "My Awesome Folder"
        }
    ],
    "tips": [],
    "fees": {
        "AYFMBVmwqhbg9y5Fbj3Iasy5oxUqhauOW7PcS1sl4Dk": 1378052
    }
}
```

Note: Folders can also be created by supplying a folder as the --local-path of an upload-file command. In this case, the folder hierarchy on the local disk will be reconstructed on chain during the course of the recursive bulk upload.

# Listing Contents of a Folder (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/listing-contents-of-a-folder)

Similar to drives, the `list-folder` command can be used to fetch the metadata of each entity within a folder. But by default, the command will fetch only the immediate children of that folder (`--max-depth 0`):

```shell
ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id "29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513940"
```

Example output:

```shell

    }
]
```

To list further than the immediate children, you can make use of the flags: `--all` and `--max-depth`.

```shell
ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" --all

ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" --max-depth 2
```

In the case of private entitites, the `--with-keys` flag will make the command to include the keys in the output.

```shell
ardrive list-folder --parent-folder-id "1b027047-4cfc-4eee-88a8-9af694f660c0" -w /my/wallet.json --with-keys
```

# Moving Folders (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/moving-folders)

Moving a folder is as simple as supplying a new parent folder ID. Note that naming collisions among entities within a folder are not allowed.

```shell
ardrive move-folder --folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" --parent-folder-id "29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513921" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

# Renaming Folders (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/renaming-folders)

In order to rename a folder you must provide a name different from its current one, and it must not create naming conflicts with its sibling entities.

```shell
ardrive rename-folder --folder-id "568d5eba-dbf3-4a49-8129-1c58f7fd35bc" --folder-name "Folder with cool stuff" -w "./wallet.json"
```

# Viewing Folder Metadata (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/(working-with-folders)/viewing-folder-metadata)

To view the metadata of a folder, users can use the `folder-info` command:

```shell
ardrive folder-info --folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0"
```

# ArFS (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/arfs)

# Using the CLI

# Wallet Operations (/sdks/(clis)/ardrive-cli/wallet-operations)

Browsing of ArDrive public data is possible without the need for an [Arweave wallet][kb-wallets]. However, for all write operations, or read operations without encryption/decryption keys, you'll need a wallet.

As you utilize the CLI, you can use either your wallet file or your seed phrase interchangeably. Consider the security implications of each approach for your particular use case carefully. If at any time you'd like to generate a new wallet altogether, start by generating a new seed phase. And if you'd like to use that seed phrase in the form of a wallet file, or if you'd like to recover an existing wallet via its seed phrase, use either or both of the following commands:

```shell
ardrive generate-seedphrase
"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use"

ardrive generate-wallet -s "this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use" > /path/to/wallet/file.json
```

Public attributes of Arweave wallets can be retrieved via their 43-character Arweave wallet address. You can retrieve the wallet address associated with [your wallet file or 12-word seed phrase][kb-wallets] (e.g. wallets generated by [ArConnect][arconnect]) like so:

```shell
ardrive get-address -w /path/to/wallet/file.json

ardrive get-address -s "this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use"
HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k
```

You'll need AR in your wallet for any write operations you perform in ArDrive. You can always check your wallet balance (in both AR and Winston units) by performing:

```shell
ardrive get-balance -w /path/to/wallet/file.json

ardrive get-balance -a "HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k"
1500000000000 Winston
1.5 AR
```

If, at any time, you need to send AR out of your wallet to another wallet address, you may perform:

```shell
ardrive send-ar -w /path/to/wallet/file.json --dest-address "HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k" --ar-amount 2.12345
```

# ARIO Integrations (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/(ant-contracts)/ario-integrations)

#### releaseName()

Releases a name from the current owner and makes it available for purchase on the ARIO contract. The name must be permanently owned by the releasing wallet. If purchased within the recently returned name period (14 epochs), 50% of the purchase amount will be distributed to the ANT owner at the time of release. If no purchases in the recently returned name period, the name can be reregistered by anyone for the normal fee.

_Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._

```typescript
const { id: txId } = await ant.releaseName({

);

// dapp_ardrive.ar.io will no longer resolve to the provided transaction id
```

#### setRecord()

Deprecated: Use `setBaseNameRecord` or `setUndernameRecord` instead.

Adds or updates a record for the ANT process. The `undername` parameter is used to specify the record name. Use `@` for the base name record.

_Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._

# Static Methods (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/(ant-contracts)/static-methods)

#### ANT.fork()

Forks an existing ANT process to create a new one with the same state but potentially a different module. This is used for upgrading ANTs to new versions.

```typescript
const newProcessId = await ANT.fork({
  signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk),
  antProcessId: 'existing-ant-process-id',
  // Optional: specify a specific module ID, defaults to latest from registry
  module: 'new-module-id',
  onSigningProgress: (event, payload) => {
    console.log(`Fork progress: ${event}`);
  },
});

console.log(`Forked ANT to new process: ${newProcessId}`);
```

#### ANT.upgrade()

Static method to upgrade an ANT by forking it to the latest version and reassigning names.

```typescript
// Upgrade and reassign all affiliated names
const result = await ANT.upgrade({
  signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk),
  antProcessId: 'existing-ant-process-id',
  reassignAffiliatedNames: true,
  arioProcessId: ARIO_MAINNET_PROCESS_ID
});

// Upgrade and reassign specific names
const result = await ANT.upgrade({
  signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk),
  antProcessId: 'existing-ant-process-id',
  names: ['ardrive', 'example'],
  reassignAffiliatedNames: false,
  arioProcessId: ARIO_MAINNET_PROCESS_ID
});

console.log(`Upgraded to process: ${result.forkedProcessId}`);
console.log(`Successfully reassigned names: ${Object.keys(result.reassignedNames)}`);
console.log(`Failed reassignments: ${Object.keys(result.failedReassignedNames)}`);
```

# Transfer (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/(ant-contracts)/transfer)

#### transfer()

Transfers ownership of the ANT to a new target address. Target MUST be an Arweave address.

_Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._

```typescript
const { id: txId } = await ant.transfer(
  { target: 'aGzM_yjralacHIUo8_nQXMbh9l1cy0aksiL_x9M359f' },
  // optional additional tags
  { tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }] },
);
```

# Undername Ownership (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/(ant-contracts)/undername-ownership)

NTs support ownership of undernames:

1. **ANT Owner** - Has full control over the ANT and all records
2. **Controllers** - Can manage records but cannot transfer ANT ownership
3. **Record Owners** - Can only update their specific delegated records

When a record owner updates their own record, they **MUST** include their own address in the `owner` field. If the `owner` field is omitted or set to a different address, the record ownership will be transferred or renounced.

#### transferRecord()

Transfers ownership of a specific record (undername) to another address. This enables delegation of control for individual records within an ANT while maintaining the ANT owner's ultimate authority. The current record owner or ANT owner/controllers can transfer ownership.

_Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._

```typescript
const { id: txId } = await ant.transferRecord({
  undername: 'alice', // the subdomain/record to transfer
  recipient: 'new-owner-address-123...', // address of the new owner
});

// alice_ardrive.ar.io is now owned by the new owner address
// The new owner can update the record but not other records in the ANT
```

**CLI Usage:**

```bash
ar.io transfer-record \
  --process-id "ANT_PROCESS_ID" \
  --undername "alice" \
  --recipient "new-owner-address-123..." \
  --wallet-file "path/to/wallet.json"
```

#### Record Owner Workflow Examples

**Checking Record Ownership:**

```typescript
const record = await ant.getRecord({ undername: 'alice' });
console.log(`Record owner: ${record.owner}`);
console.log(`Transaction ID: ${record.transactionId}`);
```

**Record Owner Updating Their Own Record:**

```typescript
// Alice (record owner) updating her own record
const aliceAnt = ANT.init({
  processId: 'ANT_PROCESS_ID',
  signer: new ArweaveSigner(aliceJwk), // Alice's wallet
});

// ✅ CORRECT: Alice includes her own address as owner
const { id: txId } = await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({
  undername: 'alice',
  transactionId: 'new-content-tx-id-456...',
  ttlSeconds: 1800,
  owner: 'alice-wallet-address-123...', // MUST be Alice's own address
  displayName: 'Alice Updated Portfolio',
  description: 'Updated personal portfolio and blog',
});

// ❌ WRONG: Omitting owner field will renounce ownership
const badUpdate = await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({
  undername: 'alice',
  transactionId: 'new-content-tx-id-456...',
  ttlSeconds: 1800,
  // Missing owner field - this will renounce ownership!
});

// ❌ WRONG: Setting different owner will transfer ownership
const badTransfer = await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({
  undername: 'alice',
  transactionId: 'new-content-tx-id-456...',
  ttlSeconds: 1800,
  owner: 'someone-else-address-789...', // This transfers ownership to someone else!
});
```

**What Happens When Record Ownership is Renounced:**

If a record owner updates their record without including the `owner` field, the record becomes owned by the ANT owner/controllers again:

```typescript
// Before: alice record is owned by alice-wallet-address-123...
const recordBefore = await ant.getRecord({ undername: 'alice' });
console.log(recordBefore.owner); // "alice-wallet-address-123..."

// Alice updates without owner field
await aliceAnt.setUndernameRecord({
  undername: 'alice',
  transactionId: 'new-tx-id...',
  ttlSeconds: 900,
  // No owner field = renounces ownership
});

// After: record ownership reverts to ANT owner
const recordAfter = await ant.getRecord({ undername: 'alice' });

# Upgrade (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/(ant-contracts)/upgrade)

#### upgrade()

Upgrades an ANT by forking it to the latest version from the ANT registry and optionally reassigning ArNS names to the new process. This function first checks the version of the existing ANT, creates a new ANT using `.fork()` to the latest version, and then reassigns the ArNS names affiliated with this process to the new process.

_Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ANT.init` to sign the transaction._

```typescript
// Upgrade ANT and reassign all affiliated ArNS names to the new process
const result = await ant.upgrade();

// Upgrade ANT and reassign specific ArNS names to the new process
const result = await ant.upgrade({
  names: ['ardrive', 'example'],
});

// with callbacks
const result = await ant.upgrade({
  names: ['ardrive', 'example'],
  onSigningProgress: (event, payload) => {
    console.log(`${event}:`, payload);
    if (event === 'checking-version') {
      console.log(`Checking version: ${payload.antProcessId}`);
    }
    if (event === 'fetching-affiliated-names') {
      console.log(`Fetching affiliated names: ${payload.arioProcessId}`);
    }
    if (event === 'reassigning-name') {
      console.log(`Reassigning name: ${payload.name}`);
    }
    if (event === 'validating-names') {
      console.log(`Validating names: ${payload.names}`);
    }
    // other callback events...
  },
});

console.log(`Upgraded to process: ${result.forkedProcessId}`);
console.log(`Successfully reassigned names: ${result.reassignedNames}`);
console.log(`Failed to reassign names: ${result.failedReassignedNames}`);
```

**Parameters:**

- `reassignAffiliatedNames?: boolean` - If true, reassigns all names associated with this process to the new forked process (defaults to true when names is empty)
- `names?: string[]` - Optional array of specific names to reassign (cannot be used with `reassignAffiliatedNames: true`). These names must be affiliated with this ANT on the provided ARIO process.
- `arioProcessId?: string` - Optional ARIO process ID (defaults to mainnet)
- `antRegistryId?: string` - Optional ANT registry process ID used to resolve the latest version (defaults to mainnet registry)
- `skipVersionCheck?: boolean` - Skip checking if ANT is already latest version (defaults to false)
- `onSigningProgress?: Function` - Optional progress callback for tracking upgrade steps

**Returns:** `Promise, failedReassignedNames: Record }>`

#### getModuleId()

Gets the module ID of the current ANT process by querying its spawn transaction tags. Results are cached after the first successful fetch.

```typescript
const moduleId = await ant.getModuleId();
console.log(`ANT was spawned with module: ${moduleId}`);

// With custom GraphQL URL and retries
const moduleId = await ant.getModuleId({
  graphqlUrl: 'https://arweave.net/graphql',
  retries: 5
});
```

**Output:**

```json
"FKtQtOOtlcWCW2pXrwWFiCSlnuewMZOHCzhulVkyqBE"
```

#### getVersion()

Gets the version string of the current ANT by matching its module ID with versions from the ANT registry.

```typescript
const version = await ant.getVersion();
console.log(`ANT is running version: ${version}`);

// With custom ANT registry
const version = await ant.getVersion({
  antRegistryId: 'custom-ant-registry-id'
});
```

**Output:**

```json
"23"
```

#### isLatestVersion()

Checks if the current ANT version is the latest according to the ANT registry.

```typescript
const isLatest = await ant.isLatestVersion();
if (!isLatest) {
  console.log('ANT can be upgraded to the latest version');
}
```

**Output:**

```json
true
```

const { id: txId } = await ario.increaseOperatorStake(
  {
    qty: new ARIOToken(100).toMARIO(),
  },
  {
    tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }],
  },
);
```

#### decreaseOperatorStake()

Decreases the callers operator stake. Must be executed with a wallet registered as a gateway operator. Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction.

_Note: Requires `signer` to be provided on `ARIO.init` to sign the transaction._

```typescript
const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) });
const { id: txId } = await ario.decreaseOperatorStake(
  {
    qty: new ARIOToken(100).toMARIO(),
  },
  {
    tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }],
  },
);
```

#### redelegateStake()

Redelegates the stake of a specific address to a new gateway. Vault ID may be optionally included in order to redelegate from an existing withdrawal vault. The redelegation fee is calculated based on the fee rate and the stake amount. Users are allowed one free redelegation every seven epochs. Each additional redelegation beyond the free redelegation will increase the fee by 10%, capping at a 60% redelegation fee.

e.g: If 1000 mARIO is redelegated and the fee rate is 10%, the fee will be 100 mARIO. Resulting in 900 mARIO being redelegated to the new gateway and 100 mARIO being deducted back to the protocol balance.

```typescript
const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk) });

const { id: txId } = await ario.redelegateStake({
  target: 't4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3',
  source: 'HwFceQaMQnOBgKDpnFqCqgwKwEU5LBme1oXRuQOWSRA',
  stakeQty: new ARIOToken(1000).toMARIO(),
  vaultId: 'fDrr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kcj616RHl3',
});
```

#### getRedelegationFee()

Retrieves the fee rate as percentage required to redelegate the stake of a specific address. Fee rate ranges from 0% to 60% based on the number of redelegations since the last fee reset.

```typescript
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();

const fee = await ario.getRedelegationFee({
  address: 't4Xr0_J4Iurt7caNST02cMotaz2FIbWQ4Kbj616RHl3',
});
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "redelegationFeeRate": 10,
  "feeResetTimestamp": 1730996691117
}
```

#### getAllDelegates()

Retrieves all delegates across all gateways, paginated and sorted by the specified criteria. The `cursor` used for pagination is a `cursorId` derived from delegate address and the gatewayAddress from the previous request. e.g `address_gatewayAddress`.

```typescript
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
const delegates = await ario.getAllDelegates({
  limit: 2,
  sortBy: 'startTimestamp',
  sortOrder: 'desc',
});
```

**Output:**

```json

}
```

# General (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/(ario-contract)/general)

#### init()

Factory function to that creates a read-only or writeable client. By providing a `signer` additional write APIs that require signing, like `joinNetwork` and `delegateStake` are available. By default, a read-only client is returned and no write APIs are available.

```typescript
// read-only client
const ario = ARIO.init();

// read-write client for browser environments
const ario = ARIO.init({ signer: new ArConnectSigner(window.arweaveWallet, Arweave.init({}))});

// read-write client for node environments
const ario = ARIO.init({ signer: new ArweaveSigner(JWK) });

```

#### getInfo()

Retrieves the information of the ARIO process.

```typescript
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
const info = await ario.getInfo();
```

  "Owner": "QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ",
  "Denomination": 6,
  "Handlers": ["_eval", "_default_"], // full list of handlers, useful for debugging
  "LastCreatedEpochIndex": 31, // epoch index of the last tick
  "LastDistributedEpochIndex": 31 // epoch index of the last distribution
}
```

#### getTokenSupply()

Retrieves the total supply of tokens, returned in mARIO. The total supply includes the following:

- `total` - the total supply of all tokens
- `circulating` - the total supply minus locked, withdrawn, delegated, and staked
- `locked` - tokens that are locked in the protocol (a.k.a. vaulted)
- `withdrawn` - tokens that have been withdrawn from the protocol by operators and delegators
- `delegated` - tokens that have been delegated to gateways
- `staked` - tokens that are staked in the protocol by gateway operators
- `protocolBalance` - tokens that are held in the protocol's treasury. This is included in the circulating supply.

```typescript
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
const supply = await ario.getTokenSupply();
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "total": 1000000000000000000,
  "circulating": 998094653842520,

const balance = await ario
  .getBalance({
    address: 'QGWqtJdLLgm2ehFWiiPzMaoFLD50CnGuzZIPEdoDRGQ',
  })
  .then((balance: number) => new mARIOToken(balance).toARIO()); // convert it to ARIO for readability
```

**Output:**

```json
100000
```

#### getBalances()

Retrieves the balances of the ARIO process in `mARIO`, paginated and sorted by the specified criteria. The `cursor` used for pagination is the last wallet address from the previous request.

```typescript
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
const balances = await ario.getBalances({
  cursor: '-4xgjroXENKYhTWqrBo57HQwvDL51mMdfsdsxJy6Y2Z_sA',

const ario = ARIO.mainnet({
  signer: new ArweaveSigner(jwk),
});
const { id: txId } = await ario.transfer(
  {
    target: '-5dV7nk7waR8v4STuwPnTck1zFVkQqJh5K9q9Zik4Y5',
    qty: new ARIOToken(1000).toMARIO(),
  },
  // optional additional tags
  { tags: [{ name: 'App-Name', value: 'My-Awesome-App' }] },
);
```

# Networks (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/(ario-contract)/networks)

The SDK provides the following process IDs for the mainnet and testnet environments:

- `ARIO_MAINNET_PROCESS_ID` - Mainnet ARIO process ID (production)
- `ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID` - Testnet ARIO process ID (testing and development)
- `ARIO_DEVNET_PROCESS_ID` - Devnet ARIO process ID (development)

As of `v3.8.1` the SDK defaults all API interactions to **mainnet**. To use the **testnet** or **devnet** provide the appropriate `ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID` or `ARIO_DEVNET_PROCESS_ID` when initializing the client.

#### Mainnet

As of `v3.8.1` the SDK defaults all API interactions to **mainnet**. To use the **testnet** or **devnet** provide the appropriate `ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID` or `ARIO_DEVNET_PROCESS_ID` when initializing the client.

```typescript

const ario = ARIO.mainnet(); // or ARIO.init()
```

#### Testnet

```typescript

const testnet = ARIO.testnet(); // or ARIO.init({ processId: ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID })
```

##### Faucet

The SDK provides APIs for claiming tokens via a faucet on the AR.IO Testnet process (`tARIO`) via the [ar-io-testnet-faucet] service. All token requests require a captcha to be solved, and the faucet is rate limited to prevent abuse.

To claim testnet tokens from the testnet token faucet, you can use one of the following methods:

1. Visit [faucet.ar.io](https://faucet.ar.io) - the easiest way to quickly get tokens for testing for a single address.

2. Programmatically via the SDK - useful if you need to claim tokens for multiple addresses or dynamically within your application.

   - `ARIO.testnet().faucet.captchaUrl()` - returns the captcha URL for the testnet faucet. Open this URL in a new browser window and listen for the `ario-jwt-success` event to be emitted.
   - `ARIO.testnet().faucet.claimWithAuthToken({ authToken, recipient, quantity })` - claims tokens for the specified recipient address using the provided auth token.
   - `ARIO.testnet().faucet.verifyAuthToken({ authToken })` - verifies if the provided auth token is still valid.

  Example client-side code for claiming tokens

```typescript

const testnet = ARIO.testnet();
const captchaUrl = await ario.faucet.captchaUrl();

// open the captcha URL in the browser, and listen for the auth token event
const captchaWindow = window.open(
  captchaUrl.captchaUrl,
  '_blank',
  'width=600,height=600',
);
/**
 * The captcha URL includes a window.parent.postMessage event that is used to send the auth token to the parent window.
 * You can store the auth token in localStorage and use it to claim tokens for the duration of the auth token's expiration (default 1 hour).
 */
window.parent.addEventListener('message', async (event) => {
  if (event.data.type === 'ario-jwt-success') {
    localStorage.setItem('ario-jwt', event.data.token);
    localStorage.setItem('ario-jwt-expires-at', event.data.expiresAt);
    // close our captcha window
    captchaWindow?.close();
    // claim the tokens using the JWT token
    const res = await testnet.faucet
      .claimWithAuthToken({
        authToken: event.data.token,
        recipient: await window.arweaveWallet.getActiveAddress(),
        quantity: new ARIOToken(100).toMARIO().valueOf(), // 100 ARIO
      })
      .then((res) => {
        alert(
          'Successfully claimed 100 ARIO tokens! Transaction ID: ' + res.id,
        );
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        alert(`Failed to claim tokens: ${err}`);
      });
  }
});

/**
 * Once you have a valid JWT, you can check if it is still valid and use it for subsequent requests without having to open the captcha again.
 */
if (
  localStorage.getItem('ario-jwt-expires-at') &&
  Date.now()

# AR.IO SDK (/sdks/ar-io-sdk)

**For AI and LLM users**: Access the complete AR.IO SDK documentation in plain text
  format at [llm.txt](/sdks/ar-io-sdk/llm.txt) for easy consumption by AI agents
  and language models.

# AR.IO SDK

Please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-sdk) for SDK details.

# Logging (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/logging)

The library uses a lightweight console logger by default for both Node.js and web environments. The logger outputs structured JSON logs with timestamps. You can configure the log level via `setLogLevel()` API or provide a custom logger that satisfies the `ILogger` interface.

#### Default Logger

```typescript

// set the log level
Logger.default.setLogLevel('debug');

// Create a new logger instance with a specific level
const logger = new Logger({ level: 'debug' });
```

#### Custom Logger Implementation

You can provide any custom logger that implements the `ILogger` interface:

```typescript

// Custom logger example
const customLogger: ILogger = {
  info: (message, ...args) => console.log(`[INFO] ${message}`, ...args),
  warn: (message, ...args) => console.warn(`[WARN] ${message}`, ...args),
  error: (message, ...args) => console.error(`[ERROR] ${message}`, ...args),
  debug: (message, ...args) => console.debug(`[DEBUG] ${message}`, ...args),
  setLogLevel: (level) => {
    /* implement level filtering */
  },
};

// Use custom logger with any class
const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ logger: customLogger });

// or set it as the default logger in the entire SDK
Logger.default = customLogger;
```

#### Winston Logger (Optional)

For advanced logging features, you can optionally install Winston and use the provided Winston logger adapter:

```bash
yarn add winston
```

```typescript

// Create Winston logger with custom configuration
const winstonLogger = new WinstonLogger({
  level: 'debug',
});

// Use with any class that accepts a logger
const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ logger: winstonLogger });

// or set it as the default logger in the entire SDK
Logger.default = winstonLogger;
```

#### Other Popular Loggers

You can easily integrate other popular logging libraries:

```typescript
// Bunyan example

const bunyanLogger = bunyan.createLogger({ name: 'ar-io-sdk' });
const adapter: ILogger = {
  info: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.info({ args }, message),
  warn: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.warn({ args }, message),
  error: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.error({ args }, message),
  debug: (message, ...args) => bunyanLogger.debug({ args }, message),
  setLogLevel: (level) => bunyanLogger.level(level),
};

const ario = ARIO.mainnet({ logger: adapter });

// or set it as the default logger in the entire SDK
Logger.default = adapter;
```

# Pagination (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/pagination)

#### Overview

Certain APIs that could return a large amount of data are paginated using cursors. The SDK uses the `cursor` pattern (as opposed to pages) to better protect against changing data while paginating through a list of items. For more information on pagination strategies refer to [this article](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/api-pagination-best-practices#api-pagination-techniques-).

Paginated results include the following properties:

- `items`: the list of items on the current request, defaulted to 100 items.
- `nextCursor`: the cursor to use for the next batch of items. This is `undefined` if there are no more items to fetch.
- `hasMore`: a boolean indicating if there are more items to fetch. This is `false` if there are no more items to fetch.
- `totalItems`: the total number of items available. This may change as new items are added to the list, only use this for informational purposes.
- `sortBy`: the field used to sort the items, by default this is `startTimestamp`.
- `sortOrder`: the order used to sort the items, by default this is `desc`.

To request all the items in a list, you can iterate through the list using the `nextCursor` until `hasMore` is `false`.

```typescript
let hasMore = true;
let cursor: string | undefined;
const gateaways = [];
while (hasMore) {
  const page = await ario.getGateways({ limit: 100, cursor });
  gateaways.push(...items);
  cursor = page.nextCursor;
  hasMore = page.hasMore;
}
```

#### Filtering

Paginated APIs also support filtering by providing a `filters` parameter. Filters can be applied to any field in the response. When multiple keys are provided, they are treated as AND conditions (all conditions must match). When multiple values are provided for a single key (as an array), they are treated as OR conditions (any value can match).

Example:

```typescript
const records = await ario.getArNSRecords({
  filters: {
    type: 'lease',
    processId: [
      'ZkgLfyHALs5koxzojpcsEFAKA8fbpzP7l-tbM7wmQNM',
      'r61rbOjyXx3u644nGl9bkwLWlWmArMEzQgxBo2R-Vu0',
    ],
  },
});
```

In the example above, the query will return ArNS records where:

- The type is "lease" AND
- The processId is EITHER "ZkgLfyHALs5koxzojpcsEFAKA8fbpzP7l-tbM7wmQNM" OR "r61rbOjyXx3u644nGl9bkwLWlWmArMEzQgxBo2R-Vu0"

# Token Conversion (/sdks/ar-io-sdk/token-conversion)

The ARIO process stores all values as mARIO (milli-ARIO) to avoid floating-point arithmetic issues. The SDK provides an `ARIOToken` and `mARIOToken` classes to handle the conversion between ARIO and mARIO, along with rounding logic for precision.

**All process interactions expect values in mARIO. If numbers are provided as inputs, they are assumed to be in raw mARIO values.**

#### Converting ARIO to mARIO

```typescript

const arioValue = 1;
const mARIOValue = new ARIOToken(arioValue).toMARIO();

const mARIOValue = 1_000_000;
const arioValue = new mARIOToken(mARIOValue).toARIO();
```

# Anonymous Operations (/sdks/ardrive-core-js/(advanced-features)/anonymous-operations)

Use ArDrive without a wallet for read-only operations:

```typescript

const anonymousArDrive = arDriveAnonymousFactory({});

// Read public data
const publicFile = await anonymousArDrive.getPublicFile({ fileId });
const folderContents = await anonymousArDrive.listPublicFolder({ folderId });
```

# Bundle Support (/sdks/ardrive-core-js/(advanced-features)/bundle-support)

Large uploads are automatically bundled for efficiency:

```typescript
// Bundling happens automatically for multiple files
const bulkResult = await arDrive.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: manyFiles,
  // Bundling is handled internally
});
```

# Caching (/sdks/ardrive-core-js/(advanced-features)/caching)

ArDrive Core maintains a metadata cache for improved performance:

```shell
Windows: /ardrive-caches/metadata
Non-Windows: /.ardrive/caches/metadata
```

Enable cache logging:
```bash
```

# Community Features (/sdks/ardrive-core-js/(advanced-features)/community-features)

Send tips to the ArDrive community:

```typescript
// Send community tip
await arDrive.sendCommunityTip({
  tokenAmount: new Winston(1000000000000), // 1 AR
  walletAddress,
  communityWalletAddress
});
```

# Manifest Creation (/sdks/ardrive-core-js/(advanced-features)/manifest-creation)

Create Arweave manifests for web hosting:

```typescript
// Create a manifest for a folder
const manifest = await arDrive.uploadPublicManifest({
  folderId,
  destManifestName: 'index.html',
  conflictResolution: 'upsert'
});

// Access: https://arweave.net/{manifestId}
```

# Progress Tracking (/sdks/ardrive-core-js/(advanced-features)/progress-tracking)

Enable upload progress logging:

```bash
```

Progress will be logged to stderr:
```
Uploading file transaction 1 of total 2 transactions...
Transaction _GKQasQX194a364Hph8Oe-oku1AdfHwxWOw9_JC1yjc Upload Progress: 0%
Transaction _GKQasQX194a364Hph8Oe-oku1AdfHwxWOw9_JC1yjc Upload Progress: 35%

```typescript
// Enable Turbo
const arDriveWithTurbo = arDriveFactory({ 
  wallet: myWallet, 
  turboSettings: {} 
});

// Uploads will automatically use Turbo
const result = await arDriveWithTurbo.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: [{ wrappedEntity, destFolderId }]
});
```

## Choose Your SDK

Each SDK serves a specific purpose in the AR.IO ecosystem:

- **Turbo SDK** - For applications that need fast, reliable data uploads to Arweave
- **AR.IO SDK** - For interacting with AR.IO Network smart contracts and services  
- **Wayfinder SDK** - For decentralized data access with built-in verification and gateway routing

All SDKs are available for both Node.js and browser environments, with TypeScript support included.

## Next Steps

# TurboAuthenticatedClient (/sdks/turbo-sdk/(apis)/turboauthenticatedclient)

#### getBalance()

Issues a signed request to get the credit balance of a wallet measured in AR (measured in Winston Credits, or winc).

```typescript
const { winc: balance } = await turbo.getBalance();
```

#### signer.getNativeAddress()

Returns the [native address][docs/native-address] of the connected signer.

```typescript
const address = await turbo.signer.getNativeAddress();
```

#### getWincForFiat()

Returns the current amount of Winston Credits including all adjustments for the provided fiat currency, amount, and optional promo codes.

```typescript
const { winc, paymentAmount, quotedPaymentAmount, adjustments } =
  await turbo.getWincForFiat({
    amount: USD(100),
    promoCodes: ['MY_PROMO_CODE'], // promo codes require an authenticated client
  });
```

#### createCheckoutSession()

Creates a Stripe checkout session for a Turbo Top Up with the provided amount, currency, owner, and optional promo codes. The returned URL can be opened in the browser, all payments are processed by Stripe. Promo codes require an authenticated client.

```typescript
const { url, winc, paymentAmount, quotedPaymentAmount, adjustments } =
  await turbo.createCheckoutSession({
    amount: USD(10.0), // $10.00 USD
    owner: publicArweaveAddress,
    promoCodes: ['MY_PROMO_CODE'], // promo codes require an authenticated client
  });

// open checkout session in a browser
window.open(url, '_blank');
```

#### upload()

The easiest way to upload data to Turbo. The `signal` is an optional [AbortSignal] that can be used to cancel the upload or timeout the request. `dataItemOpts` is an optional object that can be used to configure tags, target, and anchor for the data item upload.

```typescript
const uploadResult = await turbo.upload({
  data: 'The contents of my file!',
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000), // cancel the upload after 10 seconds
  dataItemOpts: {
    // optional
  },
  events: {
    // optional
  },
});
```

#### uploadFile()

Signs and uploads a raw file. There are two ways to provide the file to the SDK:

1. Using a `file` parameter
2. Using a `fileStreamFactory` and `fileSizeFactory`

##### Using file`

In Web with a file input:

```typescript
const selectedFile = e.target.files[0];
const uploadResult = await turbo.uploadFile({
  file: selectedFile,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [{ name: 'Content-Type', value: 'text/plain' }],
  },
  events: {
    onUploadProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => {
      console.log('Upload progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes });
    },
    onUploadError: (error) => {
      console.log('Upload error:', { error });
    },
    onUploadSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Upload success!');
    },
  },
});
```

In NodeJS with a file path:

```typescript
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, './my-unsigned-file.txt');
const fileSize = fs.stateSync(filePath).size;
const uploadResult = await turbo.uploadFile({
  file: filePath,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [{ name: 'Content-Type', value: 'text/plain' }],
  },
});
```

##### Using fileStreamFactory` and `fileSizeFactory`

Note: The provided `fileStreamFactory` should produce a NEW file data stream each time it is invoked. The `fileSizeFactory` is a function that returns the size of the file. The `signal` is an optional [AbortSignal] that can be used to cancel the upload or timeout the request. `dataItemOpts` is an optional object that can be used to configure tags, target, and anchor for the data item upload.

```typescript
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, './my-unsigned-file.txt');
const fileSize = fs.stateSync(filePath).size;
const uploadResult = await turbo.uploadFile({
  fileStreamFactory: () => fs.createReadStream(filePath),
  fileSizeFactory: () => fileSize,
});
```

##### Customize Multi-Part Upload Behavior

By default, the Turbo upload methods will split files that are larger than 10 MiB into chunks and send them to the upload service multi-part endpoints. This behavior can be customized with the following inputs:

- `chunkByteCount`: The maximum size in bytes for each chunk. Must be between 5 MiB and 500 MiB. Defaults to 5 MiB.
- `maxChunkConcurrency`: The maximum number of chunks to upload concurrently. Defaults to 5. Reducing concurrency will slow down uploads, but reduce memory utilization and serialize network calls. Increasing it will upload faster, but can strain available resources.
- `chunkingMode`: The chunking mode to use. Can be 'auto', 'force', or 'disabled'. Defaults to 'auto'. Auto behavior means chunking is enabled if the file would be split into at least three chunks.
- `maxFinalizeMs`: The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the finalization of all chunks after the last chunk is uploaded. Defaults to 1 minute per GiB of the total file size.

```typescript
// Customize chunking behavior
await turbo.upload({
  ...params,
  chunkByteCount: 1024 * 1024 * 500, // Max chunk size
  maxChunkConcurrency: 1, // Minimize concurrency
});
```

```typescript
// Disable chunking behavior
await turbo.upload({
  ...params,
  chunkingMode: 'disabled',
});
```

```typescript
// Force chunking behavior
await turbo.upload({
  ...params,
  chunkingMode: 'force',
});
```

#### On Demand Uploads

With the upload methods, you can choose to Top Up with selected crypto token on demand if the connected wallet does not have enough credits to complete the upload.

This is done by providing the `OnDemandFunding` class to the `fundingMode` parameter on upload methods. The `maxTokenAmount` (optional) is the maximum amount of tokens in the token type's smallest unit value (e.g: Winston for arweave token type) to fund the wallet with. The `topUpBufferMultiplier` (optional) is the multiplier to apply to the estimated top-up amount to avoid underpayment during on-demand top-ups due to price fluctuations on longer uploads. Defaults to 1.1, meaning a 10% buffer.

Note: On demand API currently only available for $ARIO (`ario`), $SOL (`solana`), and $ETH on Base Network (`base-eth`) token types.

```typescript
const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({
  signer: arweaveSignerWithARIO,
  token: 'ario',
});
await turbo.upload({
  ...params,
  fundingMode: new OnDemandFunding({
    maxTokenAmount: ARIOToTokenAmount(500), // Max 500 $ARIO
    topUpBufferMultiplier: 1.1, // 10% buffer to avoid underpayment
  }),
});
```

#### uploadFolder()

Signs and uploads a folder of files. For NodeJS, the `folderPath` of the folder to upload is required. For the browser, an array of `files` is required. The `dataItemOpts` is an optional object that can be used to configure tags, target, and anchor for the data item upload. The `signal` is an optional [AbortSignal] that can be used to cancel the upload or timeout the request. The `maxConcurrentUploads` is an optional number that can be used to limit the number of concurrent uploads. The `throwOnFailure` is an optional boolean that can be used to throw an error if any upload fails. The `manifestOptions` is an optional object that can be used to configure the manifest file, including a custom index file, fallback file, or whether to disable manifests altogether. Manifests are enabled by default.

##### NodeJS Upload Folder

```typescript
const folderPath = path.join(__dirname, './my-folder');
const { manifest, fileResponses, manifestResponse } = await turbo.uploadFolder({
  folderPath,
  dataItemOpts: {
    // optional
    tags: [
      {
        // User defined content type will overwrite file content type
        name: 'Content-Type',
        value: 'text/plain',
      },
      {
        name: 'My-Custom-Tag',
        value: 'my-custom-value',
      },
    ],
    // no timeout or AbortSignal provided
  },
  manifestOptions: {
    // optional
    indexFile: 'custom-index.html',
    fallbackFile: 'custom-fallback.html',
    disableManifests: false,
  },
});
```

##### Browser Upload Folder

```html

  const folderInput = document.getElementById('folder');

  folderInput.addEventListener('change', async (event) => {
    const selectedFiles = folderInput.files;
    console.log('Folder selected:', selectedFiles);

    const { manifest, fileResponses, manifestResponse } =
      await turbo.uploadFolder({
        files: Array.from(selectedFiles).map((file) => file),
      });

    console.log(manifest, fileResponses, manifestResponse);
  });

```

#### topUpWithTokens()

Tops up the connected wallet with Credits by submitting a payment transaction for the token amount to the Turbo wallet and then submitting that transaction id to Turbo Payment Service for top up processing.

- The `tokenAmount` is the amount of tokens in the token type's smallest unit value (e.g: Winston for arweave token type) to fund the wallet with.
- The `feeMultiplier` (optional) is the multiplier to apply to the reward for the transaction to modify its chances of being mined. Credits will be added to the wallet balance after the transaction is confirmed on the given blockchain. Defaults to 1.0, meaning no multiplier.

##### Arweave (AR) Crypto Top Up

```typescript
const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'arweave' });

const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
  tokenAmount: WinstonToTokenAmount(100_000_000), // 0.0001 AR
  feeMultiplier: 1.1, // 10% increase in reward for improved mining chances
});
```

##### AR.IO Network (ARIO) Crypto Top Up

```typescript
const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer, token: 'ario' });

const { winc, status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
  tokenAmount: ARIOToTokenAmount(100), // 100 $ARIO
});
```

##### Ethereum (ETH) Crypto Top Up

```

#### submitFundTransaction()

Submits the transaction ID of a funding transaction to Turbo Payment Service for top up processing. The `txId` is the transaction ID of the transaction to be submitted.

Use this API if you've already executed your token transfer to the Turbo wallet. Otherwise, consider using `topUpWithTokens` to execute a new token transfer to the Turbo wallet and submit its resulting transaction ID for top up processing all in one go

```typescript
const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated(); // defaults to arweave token type
const { status, id, ...fundResult } = await turbo.submitFundTransaction({
  txId: 'my-valid-arweave-fund-transaction-id',
});
```

# Events (/sdks/turbo-sdk/events)

The SDK provides events for tracking the state signing and uploading data to Turbo. You can listen to these events by providing a callback function to the `events` parameter of the `upload`, `uploadFile`, and `uploadSignedDataItem` methods.

- `onProgress` - emitted when the overall progress changes (includes both upload and signing). Each event consists of the total bytes, processed bytes, and the step (upload or signing)
- `onError` - emitted when the overall upload or signing fails (includes both upload and signing)
- `onSuccess` - emitted when the overall upload or signing succeeds (includes both upload and signing) - this is the last event emitted for the upload or signing process
- `onSigningProgress` - emitted when the signing progress changes.
- `onSigningError` - emitted when the signing fails.
- `onSigningSuccess` - emitted when the signing succeeds
- `onUploadProgress` - emitted when the upload progress changes
- `onUploadError` - emitted when the upload fails
- `onUploadSuccess` - emitted when the upload succeeds

```typescript
const uploadResult = await turbo.upload({
  data: 'The contents of my file!',
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000), // cancel the upload after 10 seconds
  dataItemOpts: {
    // optional
  },
  events: {
    // overall events (includes signing and upload events)
    onProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes, step }) => {
      const percentComplete = (processedBytes / totalBytes) * 100;
      console.log('Overall progress:', {
        totalBytes,
        processedBytes,
        step,
        percentComplete: percentComplete.toFixed(2) + '%', // eg 50.68%
      });
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.log('Overall error:', { error });
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Signed and upload data item!');
    },
    // upload events
    onUploadProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => {
      console.log('Upload progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes });
    },
    onUploadError: (error) => {
      console.log('Upload error:', { error });
    },
    onUploadSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Upload success!');
    },
    // signing events
    onSigningProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => {
      console.log('Signing progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes });
    },
    onSigningError: (error) => {
      console.log('Signing error:', { error });
    },
    onSigningSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Signing success!');
    },
  },
});

# Logging (/sdks/turbo-sdk/logging)

The SDK uses winston for logging. You can set the log level using the `setLogLevel` method.

```typescript
TurboFactory.setLogLevel('debug');
```

# Turbo Credit Sharing (/sdks/turbo-sdk/turbo-credit-sharing)

Users can share their purchased Credits with other users' wallets by creating Credit Share Approvals. These approvals are created by uploading a signed data item with tags indicating the recipient's wallet address, the amount of Credits to share, and an optional amount of seconds that the approval will expire in. The recipient can then use the shared Credits to pay for their own uploads to Turbo.

Shared Credits cannot be re-shared by the recipient to other recipients. Only the original owner of the Credits can share or revoke Credit Share Approvals. Credits that are shared to other wallets may not be used by the original owner of the Credits for sharing or uploading unless the Credit Share Approval is revoked or expired.

Approvals can be revoked at any time by similarly uploading a signed data item with tags indicating the recipient's wallet address. This will remove all approvals and prevent the recipient from using the shared Credits. All unused Credits from expired or revoked approvals are returned to the original owner of the Credits.

To use the shared Credits, recipient users must provide the wallet address of the user who shared the Credits with them in the `x-paid-by` HTTP header when uploading data. This tells Turbo services to look for and use Credit Share Approvals to pay for the upload before using the signer's balance.

For user convenience, during upload the Turbo CLI will use any available Credit Share Approvals found for the connected wallet before using the signing wallet's balance. To instead ignore all Credit shares and only use the signer's balance, use the `--ignore-approvals` flag. To use the signer's balance first before using Credit shares, use the `--use-signer-balance-first` flag. In contrast, the Turbo SDK layer does not provide this functionality and will only use approvals when `paidBy` is provided.

The Turbo SDK provides the following methods to manage Credit Share Approvals:

- `shareCredits`: Creates a Credit Share Approval for the specified wallet address and amount of Credits.
- `revokeCredits`: Revokes all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address.
- `listShares`: Lists all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address or connected wallet.
- `dataItemOpts: { ...opts, paidBy: string[] }`: Upload methods now accept 'paidBy', an array of wallet addresses that have provided credit share approvals to the user from which to pay, in the order provided and as necessary, for the upload.

The Turbo CLI provides the following commands to manage Credit Share Approvals:

- `share-credits`: Creates a Credit Share Approval for the specified wallet address and amount of Credits.
- `revoke-credits`: Revokes all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address.
- `list-shares`: Lists all Credit Share Approvals for the specified wallet address or connected wallet.
- `paidBy: --paid-by `: Upload commands now accept '--paid-by', an array of wallet addresses that have provided credit share approvals to the user from which to pay, in the order provided and as necessary, for the upload.
- `--ignore-approvals`: Ignore all Credit Share Approvals and only use the signer's balance.
- `--use-signer-balance-first`: Use the signer's balance first before using Credit Share Approvals.

# Automated Releases (/sdks/wayfinder/(releases)/automated-releases)

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions workflows that automate the release process:

- **Main Branch**: When changes are merged to `main`, a standard release is created
- **Alpha Branch**: When changes are merged to `alpha`, a prerelease (alpha tagged) is created

The workflow automatically:
1. Determines whether to create a prerelease or standard release based on the branch
2. Versions packages using changesets
3. Publishes to npm
4. Creates GitHub releases
5. Pushes tags back to the repository

To use the automated process:
1. Create changesets for your changes
2. Push your changes to a feature branch
3. Create a pull request to `alpha` (for prereleases) or `main` (for standard releases)
4. When the PR is merged, the release will be automatically created

# Creating a Changeset (/sdks/wayfinder/(releases)/creating-a-changeset)

To create a changeset when making changes:

```bash
npx changeset
```

This will guide you through the process of documenting your changes and selecting which packages are affected. Changesets will be used during the release process to update package versions and generate changelogs.

# Manual Release Process (/sdks/wayfinder/(releases)/manual-release-process)

If you need to release manually, follow these steps:

#### Alpha Releases

To release a new alpha version:

```bash
npx changeset version
```

3. Review the version changes and changelogs
4. Commit the changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore(release): version packages"
```

5. Publish the packages to npm:

```bash
npm run build
npx changeset publish
```

6. Push the changes and tags:

```bash
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

#### Prerelease Mode

For prerelease versions (e.g., beta, alpha):

1. Enter prerelease mode specifying the tag:

```bash
npx changeset pre enter beta
```

2. Create changesets as normal:

```bash
npx changeset
```

3. Version and publish as normal:

```bash
npx changeset version
git add .
git commit -m "chore(release): prerelease version packages"
npm run build
npx changeset publish
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

4. Exit prerelease mode when ready for a stable release:

```bash
npx changeset pre exit
```

5. Follow the normal release process for the stable version.

# Custom Providers and Strategies (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(advanced-usage)/custom-providers-and-strategies)

For advanced use cases, you can provide custom providers and strategies to `createWayfinderClient`:

```javascript

const wayfinder = createWayfinderClient({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet()
  
  // Gateway selection
  gatewaySelection: 'top-ranked',
  
  // Enable caching with custom TTL
  cache: { ttlSeconds: 3600 }, // 1 hour

  // Override 'routing' with custom routing strategy
  routingStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
    timeoutMs: 1000,
  }),

  // Override 'verification' with custom verification strategy
  verificationStrategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
    trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
  }),
});
```

# Direct Constructor Usage (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(advanced-usage)/direct-constructor-usage)

For complete control, you can use the Wayfinder constructor directly. This is useful when you need fine-grained control over the configuration:

> _Wayfinder client that caches the top 10 gateways by operator stake from the ARIO Network for 1 hour and uses the fastest pinging routing strategy to select the fastest gateway for requests._

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  // cache the top 10 gateways by operator stake from the ARIO Network for 1 hour
  gatewaysProvider: new SimpleCacheGatewaysProvider({
    ttlSeconds: 60 * 60, // cache the gateways for 1 hour
    gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
      ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
      sortBy: 'operatorStake',
      sortOrder: 'desc',
      limit: 10,
    }),
  }),
  // routing settings
  routingSettings: {
    // use the fastest pinging strategy to select the fastest gateway for requests
    strategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
      timeoutMs: 1000,
    }),
    // events
    events: {
      onRoutingStarted: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing started!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSkipped: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing skipped!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing succeeded!', event);
      },
    },
  },
  // verification settings
  verificationSettings: {
    // enable verification - if false, verification will be skipped for all requests
    enabled: true,
    // verify the data using the hash of the data against a list of trusted gateways
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
    // strict verification - if true, verification failures will cause requests to fail
    strict: true,
    // events
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log('Verification progress!', event);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log('Verification succeeded!', event);
      },
      onVerificationFailed: (event) => {
        console.log('Verification failed!', event);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

# NetworkGatewaysProvider (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/networkgatewaysprovider)

Returns a list of gateways from the ARIO Network based on on-chain metrics. You can specify on-chain metrics for gateways to prioritize the highest quality gateways. This requires installing the `@ar.io/sdk` package and importing the `ARIO` object. *It is recommended to use this provider for most use cases to leverage the AR.IO Network.*

```javascript
// requests will be routed to one of the top 10 gateways by operator stake
const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  sortBy: 'operatorStake', // sort by 'operatorStake' | 'totalDelegatedStake'
  sortOrder: 'desc', // 'asc'
  limit: 10, // number of gateways to use
  filter: (gateway) => {
    // use only active gateways that did not fail in the last epoch
    return gateway.status === 'joined' && gateway.stats.failedConsecutiveEpochs === 0;
  },
});
```

# StaticGatewaysProvider (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/staticgatewaysprovider)

The static gateway provider returns a list of gateways that you provide. This is useful for testing or for users who want to use a specific gateway for all requests.

```javascript

const gatewayProvider = new StaticGatewaysProvider({
  gateways: ['https://arweave.net'],
});
```

# TrustedPeersGatewaysProvider (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/trustedpeersgatewaysprovider)

Fetches a dynamic list of trusted peer gateways from an AR.IO gateway's `/ar-io/peers` endpoint. This provider is useful for discovering available gateways from a trusted source.

```javascript

const gatewayProvider = new TrustedPeersGatewaysProvider({
  trustedGateway: 'https://arweave.net', // Gateway to fetch peers from
});

// The provider will fetch the peer list from https://arweave.net/ar-io/peers
// and return an array of gateway URLs from the response
```

# Caching (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(installation-notes)/caching)

Wayfinder supports intelligent caching:

- **In browsers**: Uses localStorage for persistent caching across page reloads
- **In Node.js**: Uses in-memory caching
- **What's cached**: Gateway lists, routing decisions, and more
- **Cache configuration**:
  - `cache: true` - Enable with default 5-minute TTL
  - `cache: { ttlSeconds: 3600 }` - Enable with custom TTL (in seconds)
  - `cache: false` - Disable caching (default)

# Optional Dependencies (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(installation-notes)/optional-dependencies)

The `@ar.io/sdk` package is an optional peer dependency. To use AR.IO network gateways, you must explicitly provide an `ario` instance:

**With AR.IO SDK (Recommended):**
```bash
npm install @ar.io/wayfinder-core @ar.io/sdk
yarn add @ar.io/wayfinder-core @ar.io/sdk
```
- `createWayfinderClient({ ario: ARIO.mainnet() })` uses AR.IO network gateways
- Supports intelligent gateway selection criteria
- Dynamic gateway discovery and updates

# Global request events (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(monitoring-and-events)/global-request-events)

Wayfinder emits events during the routing and verification process for all requests, allowing you to monitor its operation. All events are emitted on the `wayfinder.emitter` event emitter, and are updated for each request.

```javascript
// Provide events to the Wayfinder constructor for tracking all requests
const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  routingSettings: {
    events: {
      onRoutingStarted: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing started!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSkipped: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing skipped!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing succeeded!', event);
      },
    },
  },
  verificationSettings: {
    events: {
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Verification passed for transaction: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationFailed: (event) => {
        console.error(
          `Verification failed for transaction: ${event.txId}`,
          event.error,
        );
      },
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        const percentage = (event.processedBytes / event.totalBytes) * 100;
        console.log(
          `Verification progress for ${event.txId}: ${percentage.toFixed(2)}%`,
        );
      },
    },
  },
});

// listen to the global wayfinder event emitter for all requests
wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-succeeded', (event) => {
  console.log(`Request routed to: ${event.targetGateway}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-failed', (event) => {
  console.error(`Routing failed: ${event.error.message}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-progress', (event) => {
  console.log(`Verification progress: ${event.progress}%`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-succeeded', (event) => {
  console.log(`Verification succeeded: ${event.txId}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-failed', (event) => {
  console.error(`Verification failed: ${event.error.message}`);
});
```

# Request-specific events (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(monitoring-and-events)/request-specific-events)

You can also provide events to the `request` function to track a single request. These events are called for each request and are not updated for subsequent requests.

Events are still emitted to the global event emitter for all requests. It is recommended to use the global event emitter for tracking all requests, and the request-specific events for tracking a single request.

```javascript
// create a wayfinder instance with verification enabled
const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
    },
  },
});

const response = await wayfinder.request('ar://example-name', {
  verificationSettings: {
    // these callbacks will be triggered for this request only, the global callback handlers are still called
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

# CompositeRoutingStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/compositeroutingstrategy)

Chains multiple routing strategies together, trying each sequentially until one succeeds. This strategy provides maximum resilience by allowing complex fallback scenarios where you can combine different routing approaches.

```javascript
import { 
  CompositeRoutingStrategy, 
  FastestPingRoutingStrategy, 
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  StaticRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider 
} from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';

// Example 1: Try fastest ping first, fallback to random selection
const strategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({
  strategies: [
    new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
      timeoutMs: 500,
      gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
        ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
        sortBy: 'operatorStake',
        limit: 10,
      }),
    }),
    new RandomRoutingStrategy(), // fallback if ping strategy fails
  ],
});

// Example 2: Try preferred gateway, then fastest ping, then any random gateway
const complexStrategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({
  strategies: [
    new StaticRoutingStrategy({ gateway: 'https://my-preferred-gateway.com' }),
    new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 1000 }),
    new RandomRoutingStrategy(), // final fallback
  ],
});

const gateway = await strategy.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://gateway1.com'), new URL('https://gateway2.com')],
});
```

**How it works:**
1. The composite strategy tries each routing strategy in order
2. If a strategy successfully returns a gateway, that gateway is used
3. If a strategy throws an error, the next strategy is tried
4. If all strategies fail, an error is thrown
5. The first successful strategy short-circuits the process (remaining strategies are not tried)

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Performance + Resilience**: Try fastest ping first, fallback to random if ping fails
- **Preferred + Network**: Use your own gateway first, fallback to AR.IO network selection
- **Multi-tier Fallback**: Try premium gateways, then standard gateways, then any available gateway
- **Development + Production**: Use local gateway in development, fallback to production gateways

# FastestPingRoutingStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/fastestpingroutingstrategy)

Selects the fastest gateway based on simple HEAD request to the specified route.

```javascript

// use with static gateways (override gatewaysProvider if provided)
const routingStrategy = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
  timeoutMs: 1000,
});
const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://slow.net'), new URL('https://medium.net'), new URL('https://fast.net')],
});

// use with gatewaysProvider (fetches dynamically)
const routingStrategy2 = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
  timeoutMs: 1000,
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    limit: 20,
  }),
});
const gateway2 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({ path: '/ar-io/info' }); // uses gatewaysProvider

// override the gatewaysProvider with a static list of gateways
const gateway3 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://priority-gateway.net')], // overrides gatewaysProvider
  path: '/ar-io/info'
});
```

# PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/preferredwithfallbackroutingstrategy)

Uses a preferred gateway, with a fallback strategy if the preferred gateway is not available. This is useful for builders who run their own gateways and want to use their own gateway as the preferred gateway, but also want to have a fallback strategy in case their gateway is not available.

This strategy is built using `CompositeRoutingStrategy` internally. It first attempts to ping the preferred gateway (using `PingRoutingStrategy` with `StaticRoutingStrategy`), and if that fails, it falls back to the specified fallback strategy.

```javascript

const routingStrategy = new PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy({
  preferredGateway: 'https://permagate.io',
  fallbackStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
    timeoutMs: 500,
  }),
});
```

# RandomRoutingStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/randomroutingstrategy)

Selects a random gateway from a list of gateways.

```javascript

// Option 1: Use with static gateways (override gatewaysProvider if provided)
const routingStrategy = new RandomRoutingStrategy();
const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net'), new URL('https://permagate.io')],
});

// Option 2: Use with gatewaysProvider (fetches dynamically)
const routingStrategy2 = new RandomRoutingStrategy({
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    limit: 10,
  }),
});
const gateway2 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway(); // uses gatewaysProvider

// Option 3: Override gatewaysProvider with static gateways
const gateway3 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://custom-gateway.net')], // overrides gatewaysProvider
});
```

# RoundRobinRoutingStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/roundrobinroutingstrategy)

Selects gateways in round-robin order. The gateway list is stored in memory and is not persisted across instances. You must provide either `gateways` OR `gatewaysProvider` (not both).

```javascript

// use with a static list of gateways
const routingStrategy = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
  gateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net'), new URL('https://permagate.io')],
});

// use with gatewaysProvider (loaded once and memoized)
const routingStrategy2 = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    sortOrder: 'desc',
    limit: 10,
  }),
});

const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway(); // returns the next gateway in round-robin order
```

# StaticRoutingStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/staticroutingstrategy)

```javascript

const routingStrategy = new StaticRoutingStrategy({
  gateway: 'https://arweave.net',
});

const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway(); // always returns the same gateway
```

# Strategy Composition Examples (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/strategy-composition-examples)

Here are a few “lego-style” examples showing how existing routing strategies can
be composed to suit different use cases. Each strategy implements
`RoutingStrategy`, so they can be wrapped and combined freely.

#### Random + Ping health checks

Pick a random gateway, then verify it responds with a `HEAD` request before
returning it.

```ts
import {
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

const strategy = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new RandomRoutingStrategy(),
  retries: 2,
  timeoutMs: 500,
});
```

#### Fastest ping wrapped with a simple cache

Find the lowest-latency gateway and cache the result for five minutes to avoid
constant pings.

```ts
import {
  FastestPingRoutingStrategy,
  SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

const strategy = new SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500 }),
  ttlSeconds: 300,
});
```

#### Preferred gateway + network fallback strategy

Attempt to use a favorite gateway, but fallback to a fastest pinging strategy using the ARIO Network if it fails.

```ts
import {
  PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy,
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// these will be our fallback gateways
const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  sortBy: 'operatorStake',
  limit: 5,
});

// this is our fallback strategy if our preferred gateway fails
const fastestPingStrategy = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
  timeoutMs: 500,
  gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider,
});

// compose the strategies together, the preferred gateway will be used first, and if it fails, the fallback strategy will be used.
const strategy = new PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy({
  preferredGateway: "https://my-gateway.example",
  fallbackStrategy: fastestPingStrategy,
});
```

#### Round-robin + ping verification

Cycle through gateways sequentially, checking each one’s health before use.

```ts
import {
  RoundRobinRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// use static gateways
const strategy = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
    gateways: [new URL("https://gw1"), new URL("https://gw2")],
  }),
});

// use a dynamic list of gateways from the ARIO Network
const strategy2 = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
    gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
      ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
      sortBy: 'operatorStake',
      limit: 5,
    }),
  }),
});
```

#### Cache around any composed strategy

Because `SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy` accepts any `RoutingStrategy`, you can
cache more complex compositions too.

```ts
import {
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
  SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// use a dynamic list of gateways from the ARIO Network
const randomStrategy = new RandomRoutingStrategy({
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    limit: 20,
  }),
});

// wrap the random strategy with a ping strategy
const pingRandom = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: randomStrategy,
});

// wrap the ping random strategy with a cache strategy, caching the selected gateway for 10 minutes
const cachedStrategy = new SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: pingRandom,
  ttlSeconds: 600,
});
```

#### Complex multi-strategy fallback with CompositeRoutingStrategy

Chain multiple strategies together for maximum resilience - try fastest ping first, then fall back to random selection if ping fails.

```ts
import {
  CompositeRoutingStrategy,
  FastestPingRoutingStrategy,
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// Define gateway provider for both strategies
const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  sortBy: 'operatorStake',
  limit: 15,
});

// Create a composite strategy that tries fastest ping first, then random
const strategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({
  strategies: [
    // Try fastest ping first (high performance, but may fail if all gateways are slow)
    new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
      timeoutMs: 500,
      gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider,
    }),
    // Fallback to random selection (guaranteed to work if gateways exist)
    new RandomRoutingStrategy({
      gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider,
    }),
  ],
});
```

In all cases, you can supply the composed strategy to `Wayfinder` (or whatever
router factory you use) and pass in a gateways provider:

```ts

const router = new Wayfinder({
  gatewaysProvider: new StaticGatewaysProvider({
    gateways: [new URL("https://gw1"), new URL("https://gw2")],
  }),
  routingStrategy: strategy, // any of the compositions above
});
```

# DataRootVerificationStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/datarootverificationstrategy)

Verifies data integrity using Arweave by computing the data root for the transaction. This is useful for L1 transactions and is recommended for users who want to ensure the integrity of their data.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new DataRootVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
  },
});
```

# HashVerificationStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/hashverificationstrategy)

Verifies data integrity using SHA-256 hash comparison. This is the default verification strategy and is recommended for most users looking for a balance between security and performance.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
  },
});
```

# RemoteVerificationStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/remoteverificationstrategy)

This strategy is used to verify data by checking the `x-ar-io-verified` header from the gateway that returned the data. If the header is set to `true`, the data is considered verified and trusted.

This strategy is only recommended for users fetching data from their own gateways and want to avoid the overhead of the other verification strategies.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    // no trusted gateways are required for this strategy
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new RemoteVerificationStrategy(),
  },
});
```

# SignatureVerificationStrategy (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/signatureverificationstrategy)

Verifies signatures of Arweave transactions and data items. Headers are retrieved from trusted gateways for use during verification. For a transaction, its data root is computed while streaming its data and then utilized alongside its headers for verification. For data items, the ANS-104 deep hash method of signature verification is used.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new SignatureVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
  },
});
```

# Dynamic Routing (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/dynamic-routing)

Wayfinder supports a `resolveUrl` method which generates dynamic redirect URLs to a target gateway based on the provided routing strategy. This function can be used to directly replace any hard-coded gateway URLs, and instead use Wayfinder's routing logic to select a gateway for the request.

#### ArNS names

Given an ArNS name, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  arnsName: 'ardrive',
});
// results in https://ardrive.\
```

#### Transaction Ids

Given a txId, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  txId: 'example-tx-id',
});
// results in https://\/example-tx-id
```

#### Legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URLs

Given a legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'https://arweave.net/example-tx-id',
});
// results in https://\/example-tx-id
```

#### ar:// URLs

Given an ar:// URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'ar://example-name/subpath?query=value',
});
// results in https://\/example-name/subpath?query=value
```

        Wayfinder->>Wayfinder: Emit 'verification-failed' event
        Wayfinder-->>Client: Throw verification error
    end

    deactivate Wayfinder
```

# Telemetry (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-core/telemetry)

Wayfinder can optionally emit OpenTelemetry spans for every request. **By default, telemetry is disabled**. You can control this behavior with the `telemetrySettings` option.

```javascript

const wayfinder = createWayfinderClient({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  // other settings...
  telemetrySettings: {
    enabled: true, // disabled by default (must be explicitly enabled)
    sampleRate: 0.1, // 10% sample rate by default
    exporterUrl: 'https://your-custom-otel-exporter', // optional, defaults to https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces
    clientName: 'my-custom-client-name', // optional, defaults to wayfinder-core
    clientVersion: '1.0.0', // optional, defaults to empty
  },
});
```

# useWayfinderRequest (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-react/(hooks)/usewayfinderrequest)

Fetch the data via wayfinder, and optionally verify the data.

```tsx

function WayfinderData({ txId }: { txId: string }) {
  const request = useWayfinderRequest();
  const [data, setData] = useState\(null);
  const [dataLoading, setDataLoading] = useState(false);
  const [dataError, setDataError] = useState\(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      try {
        setDataLoading(true);
        setDataError(null);
        // fetch the data for the txId using wayfinder
        const response = await request(`ar://${txId}`, {
          verificationSettings: {
            enabled: true, // enable verification on the request
            strict: true, // don't use the data if it's not verified
          },
        });
        const data = await response.arrayBuffer(); // or response.json() if you want to parse the data as JSON
        setData(data);
      } catch (error) {
        setDataError(error as Error);
      } finally {
        setDataLoading(false);
      }
    })();
  }, [request, txId]);

  if (dataError) {
    return Error loading data: {dataError.message};
  }

  if (dataLoading) {
    return Loading data...;
  }

  if (!data) {
    return No data;
  }

  return (
    
      {data}
    
  );
}
```

# useWayfinderUrl (/sdks/wayfinder/wayfinder-react/(hooks)/usewayfinderurl)

Get a dynamic URL for an existing `ar://` URL or legacy `arweave.net`/`arweave.dev` URL.

Example:

```tsx

function WayfinderImage({ txId }: { txId: string }) {
  const { resolvedUrl, isLoading, error } = useWayfinderUrl({ txId });

  if (error) {
    return Error resolving URL: {error.message};
  }

  if (isLoading) {
    return Resolving URL...;
  }

  return (
    
  );
}
```

# Wayfinder React

Please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ar-io/wayfinder/tree/main/packages/wayfinder-react) for SDK details.

# What is it? (/sdks/wayfinder/what-is-it)

Wayfinder is a simple, open-source client-side routing and verification protocol for the permaweb. It leverages the [AR.IO Network](https://ar.io) to route users to the most optimal gateway for a given request.

# Who is it for? (/sdks/wayfinder/who-is-it-for)

- **Builders** who need reliable, decentralized access to Arweave data through the powerful [AR.IO Network](https://ar.io)
- **Browsers** who demand complete control over their permaweb journey with customizable gateways and robust verification settings for enhanced security and reliability
- **Operators** who power the [AR.IO Network](https://ar.io) and want to earn rewards* for serving wayfinder traffic to the growing permaweb ecosystem
