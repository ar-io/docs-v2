# Automated Releases (/(releases)/automated-releases)

This repository is configured with GitHub Actions workflows that automate the release process:

- **Main Branch**: When changes are merged to `main`, a standard release is created
- **Alpha Branch**: When changes are merged to `alpha`, a prerelease (alpha tagged) is created

The workflow automatically:
1. Determines whether to create a prerelease or standard release based on the branch
2. Versions packages using changesets
3. Publishes to npm
4. Creates GitHub releases
5. Pushes tags back to the repository

To use the automated process:
1. Create changesets for your changes
2. Push your changes to a feature branch
3. Create a pull request to `alpha` (for prereleases) or `main` (for standard releases)
4. When the PR is merged, the release will be automatically created

# Creating a Changeset (/(releases)/creating-a-changeset)

To create a changeset when making changes:

```bash
npx changeset
```

This will guide you through the process of documenting your changes and selecting which packages are affected. Changesets will be used during the release process to update package versions and generate changelogs.

# Manual Release Process (/(releases)/manual-release-process)

If you need to release manually, follow these steps:

#### Alpha Releases

To release a new alpha version:

```bash
npx changeset version
```

3. Review the version changes and changelogs
4. Commit the changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore(release): version packages"
```

5. Publish the packages to npm:

```bash
npm run build
npx changeset publish
```

6. Push the changes and tags:

```bash
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

#### Prerelease Mode

For prerelease versions (e.g., beta, alpha):

1. Enter prerelease mode specifying the tag:

```bash
npx changeset pre enter beta
```

2. Create changesets as normal:

```bash
npx changeset
```

3. Version and publish as normal:

```bash
npx changeset version
git add .
git commit -m "chore(release): prerelease version packages"
npm run build
npx changeset publish
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

4. Exit prerelease mode when ready for a stable release:

```bash
npx changeset pre exit
```

5. Follow the normal release process for the stable version.

# Architecture (/architecture)

- Code to interfaces.
- Prefer type safety over runtime safety.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Prefer integration tests over unit tests.

# Contributing (/contributing)

1. Branch from `alpha`
2. Create a new branch for your changes (e.g. `feat/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes on your branch, push them to your branch
4. As you make commits/changes or once you're ready to release, create a changeset describing your changes via `npx changeset`.
5. Follow the prompts to select the packages that are affected by your changes.
6. Add and commit the changeset to your branch
7. Request review from a maintainer, and once approved, merge your changes into the `alpha` branch
8. A release PR will be automatically created with all pending changesets to the `alpha` branch
9. The maintainer will review the PR and merge it into `alpha`, which will trigger the automated release process using all pending changesets

# Custom Providers and Strategies (/wayfinder-core/(advanced-usage)/custom-providers-and-strategies)

For advanced use cases, provide strategy instances explicitly:

```javascript
import {
  createWayfinderClient,
  FastestPingRoutingStrategy,
  HashVerificationStrategy,
} from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';

const wayfinder = createWayfinderClient({
  // Enable caching with custom TTL
  cache: { ttlSeconds: 3600 }, // 1 hour

  // Supply a bespoke routing strategy
  routingStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
    timeoutMs: 1000,
  }),

  // Configure verification explicitly
  verificationStrategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
    trustedGateways: [new URL('https://permagate.io')],
  }),
});
```

# Direct Constructor Usage (/wayfinder-core/(advanced-usage)/direct-constructor-usage)

For complete control, you can use the Wayfinder constructor directly. This is useful when you need fine-grained control over the configuration:

> _Wayfinder client that caches the top 10 gateways by operator stake from the ARIO Network for 1 hour and uses the fastest pinging routing strategy to select the fastest gateway for requests._

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  // cache the top 10 gateways by operator stake from the ARIO Network for 1 hour
  gatewaysProvider: new SimpleCacheGatewaysProvider({
    ttlSeconds: 60 * 60, // cache the gateways for 1 hour
    gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
      ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
      sortBy: 'operatorStake',
      sortOrder: 'desc',
      limit: 10,
    }),
  }),
  // routing settings
  routingSettings: {
    // use the fastest pinging strategy to select the fastest gateway for requests
    strategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
      timeoutMs: 1000,
    }),
    // events
    events: {
      onRoutingStarted: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing started!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSkipped: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing skipped!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing succeeded!', event);
      },
    },
  },
  // verification settings
  verificationSettings: {
    // enable verification - if false, verification will be skipped for all requests
    enabled: true,
    // verify the data using the hash of the data against a list of trusted gateways
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: [new URL('https://permagate.io')],
    }),
    // strict verification - if true, verification failures will cause requests to fail
    strict: true,
    // events
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log('Verification progress!', event);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log('Verification succeeded!', event);
      },
      onVerificationFailed: (event) => {
        console.log('Verification failed!', event);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

# NetworkGatewaysProvider (/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/networkgatewaysprovider)

Returns a list of gateways from the ARIO Network based on on-chain metrics. You can specify on-chain metrics for gateways to prioritize the highest quality gateways. This requires installing the `@ar.io/sdk` package and importing the `ARIO` object. *It is recommended to use this provider for most use cases to leverage the AR.IO Network.*

```javascript
// requests will be routed to one of the top 10 gateways by operator stake
const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  sortBy: 'operatorStake', // sort by 'operatorStake' | 'totalDelegatedStake'
  sortOrder: 'desc', // 'asc'
  limit: 10, // number of gateways to use
  filter: (gateway) => {
    // use only active gateways that did not fail in the last epoch
    return gateway.status === 'joined' && gateway.stats.failedConsecutiveEpochs === 0;
  },
});
```

# StaticGatewaysProvider (/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/staticgatewaysprovider)

The static gateway provider returns a list of gateways that you provide. This is useful for testing or for users who want to use a specific gateway for all requests.

```javascript

const gatewayProvider = new StaticGatewaysProvider({
  gateways: ['https://arweave.net'],
});
```

# TrustedPeersGatewaysProvider (/wayfinder-core/(gateway-providers)/trustedpeersgatewaysprovider)

Fetches a dynamic list of trusted peer gateways from an AR.IO gateway's `/ar-io/peers` endpoint. This provider is useful for discovering available gateways from a trusted source.

```javascript

const gatewayProvider = new TrustedPeersGatewaysProvider({
  trustedGateway: 'https://arweave.net', // Gateway to fetch peers from
});

// The provider will fetch the peer list from https://arweave.net/ar-io/peers
// and return an array of gateway URLs from the response
```

# Caching (/wayfinder-core/(installation-notes)/caching)

Wayfinder supports intelligent caching:

- **In browsers**: Uses localStorage for persistent caching across page reloads
- **In Node.js**: Uses in-memory caching
- **What's cached**: Gateway lists, routing decisions, and more
- **Cache configuration**:
  - `cache: true` - Enable with default 5-minute TTL
  - `cache: { ttlSeconds: 3600 }` - Enable with custom TTL (in seconds)
  - `cache: false` - Disable caching (default)

# Optional Dependencies (/wayfinder-core/(installation-notes)/optional-dependencies)

The `@ar.io/sdk` package is an optional peer dependency. To use AR.IO network gateways, instantiate a `NetworkGatewaysProvider` with an `ario` instance and supply it to `Wayfinder` directly:

**With AR.IO SDK (Recommended):**
```bash
npm install @ar.io/wayfinder-core @ar.io/sdk
yarn add @ar.io/wayfinder-core @ar.io/sdk
```
- `new NetworkGatewaysProvider({ ario: ARIO.mainnet() })` exposes AR.IO network gateways
- Supports intelligent gateway selection criteria
- Dynamic gateway discovery and updates

# Global request events (/wayfinder-core/(monitoring-and-events)/global-request-events)

Wayfinder emits events during the routing and verification process for all requests, allowing you to monitor its operation. All events are emitted on the `wayfinder.emitter` event emitter, and are updated for each request.

```javascript
// Provide events to the Wayfinder constructor for tracking all requests
const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  routingSettings: {
    events: {
      onRoutingStarted: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing started!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSkipped: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing skipped!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing succeeded!', event);
      },
    },
  },
  verificationSettings: {
    events: {
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Verification passed for transaction: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationFailed: (event) => {
        console.error(
          `Verification failed for transaction: ${event.txId}`,
          event.error,
        );
      },
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        const percentage = (event.processedBytes / event.totalBytes) * 100;
        console.log(
          `Verification progress for ${event.txId}: ${percentage.toFixed(2)}%`,
        );
      },
    },
  },
});

// listen to the global wayfinder event emitter for all requests
wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-succeeded', (event) => {
  console.log(`Request routed to: ${event.targetGateway}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-failed', (event) => {
  console.error(`Routing failed: ${event.error.message}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-progress', (event) => {
  console.log(`Verification progress: ${event.progress}%`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-succeeded', (event) => {
  console.log(`Verification succeeded: ${event.txId}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-failed', (event) => {
  console.error(`Verification failed: ${event.error.message}`);
});
```

# Request-specific events (/wayfinder-core/(monitoring-and-events)/request-specific-events)

You can also provide events to the `request` function to track a single request. These events are called for each request and are not updated for subsequent requests.

Events are still emitted to the global event emitter for all requests. It is recommended to use the global event emitter for tracking all requests, and the request-specific events for tracking a single request.

```javascript
// create a wayfinder instance with verification enabled
const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
    },
  },
});

const response = await wayfinder.request('ar://example-name', {
  verificationSettings: {
    // these callbacks will be triggered for this request only, the global callback handlers are still called
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

# CompositeRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/compositeroutingstrategy)

Chains multiple routing strategies together, trying each sequentially until one succeeds. This strategy provides maximum resilience by allowing complex fallback scenarios where you can combine different routing approaches.

```javascript
import { 
  CompositeRoutingStrategy, 
  FastestPingRoutingStrategy, 
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  StaticRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider 
} from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';

// Example 1: Try fastest ping first, fallback to random selection
const strategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({
  strategies: [
    new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
      timeoutMs: 500,
      gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
        ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
        sortBy: 'operatorStake',
        limit: 10,
      }),
    }),
    new RandomRoutingStrategy(), // fallback if ping strategy fails
  ],
});

// Example 2: Try preferred gateway, then fastest ping, then any random gateway
const complexStrategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({
  strategies: [
    new StaticRoutingStrategy({ gateway: 'https://my-preferred-gateway.com' }),
    new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 1000 }),
    new RandomRoutingStrategy(), // final fallback
  ],
});

const gateway = await strategy.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://gateway1.com'), new URL('https://gateway2.com')],
});
```

**How it works:**
1. The composite strategy tries each routing strategy in order
2. If a strategy successfully returns a gateway, that gateway is used
3. If a strategy throws an error, the next strategy is tried
4. If all strategies fail, an error is thrown
5. The first successful strategy short-circuits the process (remaining strategies are not tried)

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Performance + Resilience**: Try fastest ping first, fallback to random if ping fails
- **Preferred + Network**: Use your own gateway first, fallback to AR.IO network selection
- **Multi-tier Fallback**: Try premium gateways, then standard gateways, then any available gateway
- **Development + Production**: Use local gateway in development, fallback to production gateways

# FastestPingRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/fastestpingroutingstrategy)

Selects the fastest gateway based on simple HEAD request to the specified route.

```javascript

// use with static gateways (override gatewaysProvider if provided)
const routingStrategy = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
  timeoutMs: 1000,
});
const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://slow.net'), new URL('https://medium.net'), new URL('https://fast.net')],
});

// use with gatewaysProvider (fetches dynamically)
const routingStrategy2 = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
  timeoutMs: 1000,
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    limit: 20,
  }),
});
const gateway2 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({ path: '/ar-io/info' }); // uses gatewaysProvider

// override the gatewaysProvider with a static list of gateways
const gateway3 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://priority-gateway.net')], // overrides gatewaysProvider
  path: '/ar-io/info'
});
```

# PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/preferredwithfallbackroutingstrategy)

Uses a preferred gateway, with a fallback strategy if the preferred gateway is not available. This is useful for builders who run their own gateways and want to use their own gateway as the preferred gateway, but also want to have a fallback strategy in case their gateway is not available.

This strategy is built using `CompositeRoutingStrategy` internally. It first attempts to ping the preferred gateway (using `PingRoutingStrategy` with `StaticRoutingStrategy`), and if that fails, it falls back to the specified fallback strategy.

```javascript

const routingStrategy = new PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy({
  preferredGateway: 'https://permagate.io',
  fallbackStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
    timeoutMs: 500,
  }),
});
```

# RandomRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/randomroutingstrategy)

Selects a random gateway from a list of gateways.

```javascript

// Option 1: Use with static gateways (override gatewaysProvider if provided)
const routingStrategy = new RandomRoutingStrategy();
const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net'), new URL('https://permagate.io')],
});

// Option 2: Use with gatewaysProvider (fetches dynamically)
const routingStrategy2 = new RandomRoutingStrategy({
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    limit: 10,
  }),
});
const gateway2 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway(); // uses gatewaysProvider

// Option 3: Override gatewaysProvider with static gateways
const gateway3 = await routingStrategy2.selectGateway({
  gateways: [new URL('https://custom-gateway.net')], // overrides gatewaysProvider
});
```

# RoundRobinRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/roundrobinroutingstrategy)

Selects gateways in round-robin order. The gateway list is stored in memory and is not persisted across instances. You must provide either `gateways` OR `gatewaysProvider` (not both).

```javascript

// use with a static list of gateways
const routingStrategy = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
  gateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net'), new URL('https://permagate.io')],
});

// use with gatewaysProvider (loaded once and memoized)
const routingStrategy2 = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    sortOrder: 'desc',
    limit: 10,
  }),
});

const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway(); // returns the next gateway in round-robin order
```

# StaticRoutingStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/staticroutingstrategy)

```javascript

const routingStrategy = new StaticRoutingStrategy({
  gateway: 'https://arweave.net',
});

const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway(); // always returns the same gateway
```

# Strategy Composition Examples (/wayfinder-core/(routing-strategies)/strategy-composition-examples)

Here are a few “lego-style” examples showing how existing routing strategies can
be composed to suit different use cases. Each strategy implements
`RoutingStrategy`, so they can be wrapped and combined freely.

#### Random + Ping health checks

Pick a random gateway, then verify it responds with a `HEAD` request before
returning it.

```ts
import {
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

const strategy = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new RandomRoutingStrategy(),
  retries: 2,
  timeoutMs: 500,
});
```

#### Fastest ping wrapped with a simple cache

Find the lowest-latency gateway and cache the result for five minutes to avoid
constant pings.

```ts
import {
  FastestPingRoutingStrategy,
  SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

const strategy = new SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({ timeoutMs: 500 }),
  ttlSeconds: 300,
});
```

#### Preferred gateway + network fallback strategy

Attempt to use a favorite gateway, but fallback to a fastest pinging strategy using the ARIO Network if it fails.

```ts
import {
  PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy,
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// these will be our fallback gateways
const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  sortBy: 'operatorStake',
  limit: 5,
});

// this is our fallback strategy if our preferred gateway fails
const fastestPingStrategy = new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
  timeoutMs: 500,
  gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider,
});

// compose the strategies together, the preferred gateway will be used first, and if it fails, the fallback strategy will be used.
const strategy = new PreferredWithFallbackRoutingStrategy({
  preferredGateway: "https://my-gateway.example",
  fallbackStrategy: fastestPingStrategy,
});
```

#### Round-robin + ping verification

Cycle through gateways sequentially, checking each one’s health before use.

```ts
import {
  RoundRobinRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// use static gateways
const strategy = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
    gateways: [new URL("https://gw1"), new URL("https://gw2")],
  }),
});

// use a dynamic list of gateways from the ARIO Network
const strategy2 = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
    gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
      ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
      sortBy: 'operatorStake',
      limit: 5,
    }),
  }),
});
```

#### Cache around any composed strategy

Because `SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy` accepts any `RoutingStrategy`, you can
cache more complex compositions too.

```ts
import {
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  PingRoutingStrategy,
  SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// use a dynamic list of gateways from the ARIO Network
const randomStrategy = new RandomRoutingStrategy({
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    limit: 20,
  }),
});

// wrap the random strategy with a ping strategy
const pingRandom = new PingRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: randomStrategy,
});

// wrap the ping random strategy with a cache strategy, caching the selected gateway for 10 minutes
const cachedStrategy = new SimpleCacheRoutingStrategy({
  routingStrategy: pingRandom,
  ttlSeconds: 600,
});
```

#### Complex multi-strategy fallback with CompositeRoutingStrategy

Chain multiple strategies together for maximum resilience - try fastest ping first, then fall back to random selection if ping fails.

```ts
import {
  CompositeRoutingStrategy,
  FastestPingRoutingStrategy,
  RandomRoutingStrategy,
  NetworkGatewaysProvider,
} from "@ar.io/wayfinder-core";

// Define gateway provider for both strategies
const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  sortBy: 'operatorStake',
  limit: 15,
});

// Create a composite strategy that tries fastest ping first, then random
const strategy = new CompositeRoutingStrategy({
  strategies: [
    // Try fastest ping first (high performance, but may fail if all gateways are slow)
    new FastestPingRoutingStrategy({
      timeoutMs: 500,
      gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider,
    }),
    // Fallback to random selection (guaranteed to work if gateways exist)
    new RandomRoutingStrategy({
      gatewaysProvider: gatewayProvider,
    }),
  ],
});
```

In all cases, you can supply the composed strategy to `Wayfinder` (or whatever
router factory you use) and pass in a gateways provider:

```ts

const router = new Wayfinder({
  gatewaysProvider: new StaticGatewaysProvider({
    gateways: [new URL("https://gw1"), new URL("https://gw2")],
  }),
  routingStrategy: strategy, // any of the compositions above
});
```

# DataRootVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/datarootverificationstrategy)

Verifies data integrity using Arweave by computing the data root for the transaction. This is useful for L1 transactions and is recommended for users who want to ensure the integrity of their data.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new DataRootVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: [new URL('https://permagate.io')],
    }),
  },
});
```

# HashVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/hashverificationstrategy)

Verifies data integrity using SHA-256 hash comparison. This is the default verification strategy and is recommended for most users looking for a balance between security and performance.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: [new URL('https://permagate.io')],
    }),
  },
});
```

# RemoteVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/remoteverificationstrategy)

This strategy is used to verify data by checking the `x-ar-io-verified` header from the gateway that returned the data. If the header is set to `true`, the data is considered verified and trusted.

This strategy is only recommended for users fetching data from their own gateways and want to avoid the overhead of the other verification strategies.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    // no trusted gateways are required for this strategy
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new RemoteVerificationStrategy(),
  },
});
```

# SignatureVerificationStrategy (/wayfinder-core/(verification-strategies)/signatureverificationstrategy)

Verifies signatures of Arweave transactions and data items. Headers are retrieved from trusted gateways for use during verification. For a transaction, its data root is computed while streaming its data and then utilized alongside its headers for verification. For data items, the ANS-104 deep hash method of signature verification is used.

```javascript

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new SignatureVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: [new URL('https://permagate.io')],
    }),
  },
});
```

# Dynamic Routing (/wayfinder-core/dynamic-routing)

Wayfinder supports a `resolveUrl` method which generates dynamic redirect URLs to a target gateway based on the provided routing strategy. This function can be used to directly replace any hard-coded gateway URLs, and instead use Wayfinder's routing logic to select a gateway for the request.

#### ArNS names

Given an ArNS name, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  arnsName: 'ardrive',
});
// results in https://ardrive.\
```

#### Transaction Ids

Given a txId, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  txId: 'example-tx-id',
});
// results in https://\/example-tx-id
```

#### Legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URLs

Given a legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'https://arweave.net/example-tx-id',
});
// results in https://\/example-tx-id
```

#### ar:// URLs

Given an ar:// URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'ar://example-name/subpath?query=value',
});
// results in https://\/example-name/subpath?query=value
```

# Request Flow (/wayfinder-core/request-flow)

The following sequence diagram illustrates how Wayfinder processes requests:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Wayfinder
    participant Gateways Provider
    participant Routing Strategy
    participant Selected Gateway
    participant Verification Strategy
    participant Trusted Gateways

    Client->>Wayfinder: request('ar://example')
    activate Wayfinder

    Wayfinder->>+Gateways Provider: getGateways()
    Gateways Provider-->>-Wayfinder: List of gateway URLs

    Wayfinder->>+Routing Strategy: selectGateway() from list of gateways
    Routing Strategy-->>-Wayfinder: Select gateway for request

    Wayfinder->>+Selected Gateway: Send HTTP request to target gateway
    Selected Gateway-->>-Wayfinder: Response with data & txId

    activate Verification Strategy
    Wayfinder->>+Verification Strategy: verifyData(responseData, txId)
    Verification Strategy->>Wayfinder: Emit 'verification-progress' events
    Verification Strategy->>Trusted Gateways: Request verification headers
    Trusted Gateways-->>Verification Strategy: Return verification headers
    Verification Strategy->>Verification Strategy: Compare computed vs trusted data
    Verification Strategy-->>-Wayfinder: Return request data with verification result

    alt Verification passed
        Wayfinder->>Wayfinder: Emit 'verification-passed' event
        Wayfinder-->>Client: Return verified response
    else Verification failed
        Wayfinder->>Wayfinder: Emit 'verification-failed' event
        Wayfinder-->>Client: Throw verification error
    end

    deactivate Wayfinder
```

# Telemetry (/wayfinder-core/telemetry)

Wayfinder can optionally emit OpenTelemetry spans for every request. **By default, telemetry is disabled**. You can control this behavior with the `telemetry` option.

```javascript

const wayfinder = createWayfinderClient({
  // other settings...
  telemetry: {
    enabled: true, // disabled by default (must be explicitly enabled)
    sampleRate: 0.1, // 10% sample rate by default
    exporterUrl: 'https://your-custom-otel-exporter', // optional, defaults to https://api.honeycomb.io/v1/traces
    clientName: 'my-custom-client-name', // optional, defaults to wayfinder-core
    clientVersion: '1.0.0', // optional, defaults to empty
  },
});
```

# useWayfinderRequest (/wayfinder-react/(hooks)/usewayfinderrequest)

Fetch the data via wayfinder, and optionally verify the data.

```tsx

function WayfinderData({ txId }: { txId: string }) {
  const request = useWayfinderRequest();
  const [data, setData] = useState\(null);
  const [dataLoading, setDataLoading] = useState(false);
  const [dataError, setDataError] = useState\(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      try {
        setDataLoading(true);
        setDataError(null);
        // fetch the data for the txId using wayfinder
        const response = await request(`ar://${txId}`, {
          verificationSettings: {
            enabled: true, // enable verification on the request
            strict: true, // don't use the data if it's not verified
          },
        });
        const data = await response.arrayBuffer(); // or response.json() if you want to parse the data as JSON
        setData(data);
      } catch (error) {
        setDataError(error as Error);
      } finally {
        setDataLoading(false);
      }
    })();
  }, [request, txId]);

  if (dataError) {
    return Error loading data: {dataError.message};
  }

  if (dataLoading) {
    return Loading data...;
  }

  if (!data) {
    return No data;
  }

  return (
    
      {data}
    
  );
}
```

# useWayfinderUrl (/wayfinder-react/(hooks)/usewayfinderurl)

Get a dynamic URL for an existing `ar://` URL or legacy `arweave.net`/`arweave.dev` URL.

Example:

```tsx

function WayfinderImage({ txId }: { txId: string }) {
  const { resolvedUrl, isLoading, error } = useWayfinderUrl({ txId });

  if (error) {
    return Error resolving URL: {error.message};
  }

  if (isLoading) {
    return Resolving URL...;
  }

  return (
    
  );
}
```
