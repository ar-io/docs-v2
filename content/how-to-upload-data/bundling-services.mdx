## Why Choose Bundling Services?

**Perfect for:**

**Pros:**

- Multiple payment options (AR, ETH, credit cards, [Turbo Credits](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/turbo/credits/#overview))
- Optimized performance
- Cost-effective for large uploads
- Built-in retry mechanisms

**Cons:**

- Dependency on third-party service

## Quick Start with Turbo

[Turbo](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-sdk) provides the most comprehensive bundling service with fiat payments and advanced features.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
```

### Access your Wallet

```js
import { TurboFactory, ArweaveSigner } from "@ardrive/turbo-sdk";
import fs from "fs";

// Load your wallet
const jwk = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./my-jwk.json", "utf-8"));
const signer = new ArweaveSigner(jwk);

// Initialize Turbo
const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer });
```

### Upload Data

<CodeGroup>
```js tab="Upload File"
// Upload a file
const fileData = fs.readFileSync("./myfile.jpg");

const result = await turbo.upload({
data: fileData,
dataItemOpts: {
tags: [
{ name: "Content-Type", value: "image/jpeg" },
{ name: "Title", value: "My Image" },
],
},
});

console.log("Upload ID:", result.id);
console.log("Owner:", result.owner);

```

```js tab="Upload Raw Data"
// Upload raw data (string, JSON, etc.)
const data = JSON.stringify({
  message: "Hello Arweave!",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});

const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: data,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" },
      { name: "App-Name", value: "MyApp" },
    ],
  },
});
