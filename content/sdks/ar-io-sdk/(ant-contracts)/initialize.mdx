#### init()

Factory function to that creates a read-only or writeable client. By providing a `signer` additional write APIs that require signing, like `setRecord` and `transfer` are available. By default, a read-only client is returned and no write APIs are available.

```typescript
// in a browser environment with ArConnect
const ant = ANT.init({
  signer: new ArConnectSigner(window.arweaveWallet, Arweave.init({})),
  processId: 'bh9l1cy0aksiL_x9M359faGzM_yjralacHIUo8_nQXM'
});

// in a node environment
const ant = ANT.init({
  signer: new ArweaveSigner(JWK),
  processId: 'bh9l1cy0aksiL_x9M359faGzM_yjralacHIUo8_nQXM'
});

```
