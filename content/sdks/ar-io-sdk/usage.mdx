# Usage

The SDK is provided in both CommonJS and ESM formats and is compatible with bundlers such as Webpack, Rollup, and ESbuild. Utilize the appropriately named exports provided by this SDK's [package.json] based on your project's configuration. Refer to the [examples] directory to see how to use the SDK in various environments.

### Web

> [!WARNING]
> Polyfills are not provided by default for bundled web projects (Vite, ESBuild, Webpack, Rollup, etc.) . Depending on your apps bundler configuration and plugins, you will need to provide polyfills for various imports including `crypto`, `process` and `buffer`. Refer to [examples/webpack] and [examples/vite] for examples. For other project configurations, refer to your bundler's documentation for more information on how to provide the necessary polyfills.

#### Bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, ESbuild, etc.)

```javascript
import { ARIO } from '@ar.io/sdk/web';

// set up client
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
// fetch gateways
const gateways = await ario.getGateways();
```

#### Browser

```html
\<script type="module"\>
  // replace <@version> with a pinned version (e.g. @3.8.4) or @latest, if you're risky :)
  import { ARIO } from 'https://unpkg.com/@ar.io/sdk<@version>';

  // set up client
  const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
  // fetch gateways
  const gateways = await ario.getGateways();
\</script\>
```

### Node

#### ESM (NodeNext)

```javascript
import { ARIO } from '@ar.io/sdk/node';

// set up client
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
// fetch gateways
const gateways = await ario.getGateways();
```

#### CJS

```javascript
import { ARIO } from '@ar.io/sdk';

// set up client
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();
// fetch gateways
const gateways = await ario.getGateways();
```

### Typescript

The SDK provides TypeScript types. When you import the SDK in a TypeScript project types are exported from `./lib/types/[node/web]/index.d.ts` and should be automatically recognized by package managers, offering benefits such as type-checking and autocompletion.

> [!NOTE]
> Typescript version 5.3 or higher is recommended.
