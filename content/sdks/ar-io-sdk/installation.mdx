# Installation

Requires `node>=v18.0.0`

```shell
npm install @ar.io/sdk
```

or

```shell
yarn add @ar.io/sdk --ignore-engines
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `--ignore-engines` flag is required when using yarn, as [permaweb/aoconnect] recommends only the use of npm. Alternatively, you can add a `.yarnrc.yml` file to your project containing `ignore-engines true` to ignore the engines check.
