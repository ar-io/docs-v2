The ARIO process stores all values as mARIO (milli-ARIO) to avoid floating-point arithmetic issues. The SDK provides an `ARIOToken` and `mARIOToken` classes to handle the conversion between ARIO and mARIO, along with rounding logic for precision.

**All process interactions expect values in mARIO. If numbers are provided as inputs, they are assumed to be in raw mARIO values.**

### Converting ARIO to mARIO

```typescript
import { ARIOToken, mARIOToken } from '@ar.io/sdk';

const arioValue = 1;
const mARIOValue = new ARIOToken(arioValue).toMARIO();

const mARIOValue = 1_000_000;
const arioValue = new mARIOToken(mARIOValue).toARIO();
```
