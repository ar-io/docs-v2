Paginated APIs also support filtering by providing a `filters` parameter. Filters can be applied to any field in the response. When multiple keys are provided, they are treated as AND conditions (all conditions must match). When multiple values are provided for a single key (as an array), they are treated as OR conditions (any value can match).

Example:

```typescript
const records = await ario.getArNSRecords({
  filters: {
    type: 'lease',
    processId: [
      'ZkgLfyHALs5koxzojpcsEFAKA8fbpzP7l-tbM7wmQNM',
      'r61rbOjyXx3u644nGl9bkwLWlWmArMEzQgxBo2R-Vu0',
    ],
  },
});
```

In the example above, the query will return ArNS records where:

- The type is "lease" AND
- The processId is EITHER "ZkgLfyHALs5koxzojpcsEFAKA8fbpzP7l-tbM7wmQNM" OR "r61rbOjyXx3u644nGl9bkwLWlWmArMEzQgxBo2R-Vu0"
