Certain APIs that could return a large amount of data are paginated using cursors. The SDK uses the `cursor` pattern (as opposed to pages) to better protect against changing data while paginating through a list of items. For more information on pagination strategies refer to [this article](https://www.getknit.dev/blog/api-pagination-best-practices#api-pagination-techniques-).

Paginated results include the following properties:

- `items`: the list of items on the current request, defaulted to 100 items.
- `nextCursor`: the cursor to use for the next batch of items. This is `undefined` if there are no more items to fetch.
- `hasMore`: a boolean indicating if there are more items to fetch. This is `false` if there are no more items to fetch.
- `totalItems`: the total number of items available. This may change as new items are added to the list, only use this for informational purposes.
- `sortBy`: the field used to sort the items, by default this is `startTimestamp`.
- `sortOrder`: the order used to sort the items, by default this is `desc`.

To request all the items in a list, you can iterate through the list using the `nextCursor` until `hasMore` is `false`.

```typescript
let hasMore = true;
let cursor: string | undefined;
const gateaways = [];
while (hasMore) {
  const page = await ario.getGateways({ limit: 100, cursor });
  gateaways.push(...items);
  cursor = page.nextCursor;
  hasMore = page.hasMore;
}
```
