description: "JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interacting with the AR.IO Network, including ArNS name management, gateway interactions, and AO contract operations"
---

The AR.IO SDK provides comprehensive tools for interacting with the AR.IO Network and Arweave ecosystem. Built with TypeScript, it offers type-safe interfaces for ArNS name management, gateway operations, and AO contract interactions.

## Quick Start

```npm
npm install @ar.io/sdk
```

```javascript
import { ARIO } from '@ar.io/sdk';

// Connect to mainnet
const ario = ARIO.mainnet();

// Get gateway information
const gateways = await ario.getGateways();

// Get ArNS records
const records = await ario.getArNSRecords();

console.log('Network data:', { gateways, records });
```

## Key Features

- **ARIO Contract Operations** - Interact with the AR.IO smart contract
- **ArNS Management** - Register and manage Arweave Name System records
- **ANT Contract Integration** - Work with Arweave Name Token contracts
- **Gateway Discovery** - Find and evaluate network gateways
- **Token Operations** - Handle ARIO token conversions and management
- **Pagination Support** - Efficiently handle large datasets
