title: "Folder Upload Events"
description: "SDK for interacting with Turbo, a fast and efficient data upload service for Arweave"
---

These events are available for the `uploadFolder` method:

- `onFileStart` - emitted when a file in the folder starts uploading. Includes the file name, file size, file index, and total number of files
- `onFileProgress` - emitted when a file's upload or signing progress changes. Includes the file name, file index, total files, processed bytes for the file, total bytes for the file, and the current step (signing or upload)
- `onFileComplete` - emitted when a file successfully completes uploading. Includes the file name, file index, total files, and the data item ID
- `onFileError` - emitted when a file upload fails. Includes the file name, file index, total files, and the error
- `onFolderProgress` - emitted when the overall folder upload progress changes. Includes the number of processed files, total files, processed bytes across all files, total bytes across all files, and the current phase (files or manifest)
- `onFolderError` - emitted when the overall folder upload fails
- `onFolderSuccess` - emitted when the folder upload successfully completes (including manifest generation) - this is the last event emitted for the folder upload process

```typescript
const uploadResult = await turbo.upload({
  data: 'The contents of my file!',
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10_000), // cancel the upload after 10 seconds
  dataItemOpts: {
    // optional
  },
  events: {
    // overall events (includes signing and upload events)
    onProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes, step }) => {
      const percentComplete = (processedBytes / totalBytes) * 100;
      console.log('Overall progress:', {
        totalBytes,
        processedBytes,
        step,
        percentComplete: percentComplete.toFixed(2) + '%', // eg 50.68%
      });
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      console.log('Overall error:', { error });
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Signed and upload data item!');
    },
    // upload events
    onUploadProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => {
      console.log('Upload progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes });
    },
    onUploadError: (error) => {
      console.log('Upload error:', { error });
    },
    onUploadSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Upload success!');
    },
    // signing events
    onSigningProgress: ({ totalBytes, processedBytes }) => {
      console.log('Signing progress:', { totalBytes, processedBytes });
    },
    onSigningError: (error) => {
      console.log('Signing error:', { error });
    },
    onSigningSuccess: () => {
      console.log('Signing success!');
    },
  },
});
