These events are available for `upload`, `uploadFile`, and `uploadSignedDataItem` methods:

- `onProgress` - emitted when the overall progress changes (includes both upload and signing). Each event consists of the total bytes, processed bytes, and the step (upload or signing)
- `onError` - emitted when the overall upload or signing fails (includes both upload and signing)
- `onSuccess` - emitted when the overall upload or signing succeeds (includes both upload and signing) - this is the last event emitted for the upload or signing process
- `onSigningProgress` - emitted when the signing progress changes.
- `onSigningError` - emitted when the signing fails.
- `onSigningSuccess` - emitted when the signing succeeds
- `onUploadProgress` - emitted when the upload progress changes
- `onUploadError` - emitted when the upload fails
- `onUploadSuccess` - emitted when the upload succeeds
