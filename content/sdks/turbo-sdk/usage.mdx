# Usage

The SDK is provided in both CommonJS and ESM formats, and it's compatible with bundlers such as Webpack, Rollup, and ESbuild. Utilize the appropriately named exports provided by this SDK's [package.json] based on your project's configuration. Refer to the [examples] directory to see how to use the SDK in various environments.

### Web

> [!WARNING]
> Polyfills are not provided by default for bundled web projects (Vite, ESBuild, Webpack, Rollup, etc.) . Depending on your apps bundler configuration and plugins, you will need to provide polyfills for various imports including `crypto`, `process`, `fs` and `buffer`. Refer to your bundler's documentation for how to provide the necessary polyfills.

#### Bundlers (Webpack, Rollup, ESbuild, etc.)

```typescript
import { TurboFactory } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk/web';

const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated();
const rates = await turbo.getFiatRates();
```

#### Browser

```html
\<script type="module"\>
  import { TurboFactory } from 'https://unpkg.com/@ardrive/turbo-sdk';

  const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated();
  const rates = await turbo.getFiatRates();
\</script\>
```

### NodeJS

#### CommonJS

Full example available in the [examples/typescript/cjs].

```typescript
import { TurboFactory } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk';

const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated();
const rates = await turbo.getFiatRates();
```

#### ESM

Full example available in the [examples/typescript/esm].

```typescript
import { TurboFactory } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk/node';

const turbo = TurboFactory.unauthenticated();
const rates = await turbo.getFiatRates();
```

### Typescript

The SDK provides TypeScript types. When you import the SDK in a TypeScript project:

```typescript
import { TurboFactory } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk/<node/web>';
```

Types are exported from `./lib/types/[node/web]/index.d.ts` and should be automatically recognized, offering benefits such as type-checking and autocompletion.

### Examples

Examples are available in the [examples] directory. To run examples:

- `yarn example:web` - opens up the example web page
- `yarn example:cjs` - runs example CJS node script
- `yarn example:esm` - runs example ESM node script
