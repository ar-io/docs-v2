The Turbo SDK provides a high-level interface for uploading data to Arweave through Turbo's optimized infrastructure. Built with TypeScript, it offers seamless integration with built-in error handling, automatic retries, and transparent pricing.

## Quick Start

```npm
npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
```

```javascript
import { TurboFactory, USD } from '@ardrive/turbo-sdk';

// Create an authenticated client
const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ privateKey: yourPrivateKey });

// Upload data with automatic payment
const result = await turbo.uploadFile({
  fileStreamFactory: () => fs.createReadStream('./my-file.pdf'),
  fileSizeFactory: () => fs.statSync('./my-file.pdf').size,
});

console.log('Upload successful:', result);
```
