Use ArDrive without a wallet for read-only operations:

```typescript
import { arDriveAnonymousFactory } from 'ardrive-core-js';

const anonymousArDrive = arDriveAnonymousFactory({});

// Read public data
const publicFile = await anonymousArDrive.getPublicFile({ fileId });
const folderContents = await anonymousArDrive.listPublicFolder({ folderId });
```
