Available strategies when uploading files/folders that already exist:

```typescript
// Skip existing files
await arDrive.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: [...],
  conflictResolution: 'skip'
});

// Replace all existing files
await arDrive.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: [...],
  conflictResolution: 'replace'
});

// Update only if content differs (default)
await arDrive.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: [...],
  conflictResolution: 'upsert'
});

// Rename conflicting files
await arDrive.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: [...],
  conflictResolution: 'rename'
});

// Throw error on conflicts
await arDrive.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: [...],
  conflictResolution: 'error'
});

// Interactive prompt (CLI only)
await arDrive.uploadAllEntities({
  entitiesToUpload: [...],
  conflictResolution: 'ask'
});
```
