Browsing of ArDrive public data is possible without the need for an [Arweave wallet][kb-wallets]. However, for all write operations, or read operations without encryption/decryption keys, you'll need a wallet.

As you utilize the CLI, you can use either your wallet file or your seed phrase interchangeably. Consider the security implications of each approach for your particular use case carefully. If at any time you'd like to generate a new wallet altogether, start by generating a new seed phase. And if you'd like to use that seed phrase in the form of a wallet file, or if you'd like to recover an existing wallet via its seed phrase, use either or both of the following commands:

```shell
ardrive generate-seedphrase
"this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use"

ardrive generate-wallet -s "this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use" > /path/to/wallet/file.json
```

Public attributes of Arweave wallets can be retrieved via their 43-character Arweave wallet address. You can retrieve the wallet address associated with [your wallet file or 12-word seed phrase][kb-wallets] (e.g. wallets generated by [ArConnect][arconnect]) like so:

```shell
ardrive get-address -w /path/to/wallet/file.json

ardrive get-address -s "this is an example twelve word seed phrase that you could use"
HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k
```

You'll need AR in your wallet for any write operations you perform in ArDrive. You can always check your wallet balance (in both AR and Winston units) by performing:

```shell
ardrive get-balance -w /path/to/wallet/file.json

ardrive get-balance -a "HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k"
1500000000000 Winston
1.5 AR
```

If, at any time, you need to send AR out of your wallet to another wallet address, you may perform:

```shell
ardrive send-ar -w /path/to/wallet/file.json --dest-address "HTTn8F92tR32N8wuo-NIDkjmqPknrbl10JWo5MZ9x2k" --ar-amount 2.12345
```
