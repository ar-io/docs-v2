The ArDrive CLI's private drive and folder functions all require either a drive password OR a drive key. Private file functions require either the drive password or the file key. **Keys and passwords are sensitive data, so manage the entry, display, storage, and transmission of them very carefully.**

Drive passwords are the most portable, and fundamental, encryption facet, so a few options are available during private drive operations for supplying them:

<ul>
<li>Environment Variable</li>
<li>STDIN</li>
<li>Secure Prompt</li>
</ul>

#### Supplying Your Password: Environment Variable

```shell
read -rs TMP_ARDRIVE_PW
export ARDRIVE_DRIVE_PW=$(TMP_ARDRIVE_PW)
ardrive \<some private command\> -w /path/to/wallet.json -P
```

#### Supplying Your Password: STDIN

```shell
cat /path/to/my/drive/password.txt | ardrive \<some private command\> -w /path/to/wallet.json -P

ardrive \<some private command\> -w /path/to/wallet.json -P < /path/to/my/drive/password.txt
```

#### Supplying Your Password: Prompt

```shell
ardrive \<some private command\> -w /path/to/wallet.json -P
? Enter drive password: â€º ********
```
