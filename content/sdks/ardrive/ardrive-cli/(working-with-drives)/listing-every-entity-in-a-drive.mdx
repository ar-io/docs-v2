Useful notes on listing the contents of drives:

<ul>
<li>Listing a drive is effectively the same as listing its root folder.</li>
<li>You can control the tree depth of the data returned.</li>
<li>path, txPath, and entityIdPath properties on entities can provide useful handholds for other forms of data navigation</li>
</ul>

```shell
ardrive list-drive -d "c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50" -w /path/to/my/wallet.json -P

ardrive list-drive -d "c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50" -w /path/to/my/wallet.json -P --with-keys

ardrive list-drive -d "c7f87712-b54e-4491-bc96-1c5fa7b1da50" --max-depth 2
