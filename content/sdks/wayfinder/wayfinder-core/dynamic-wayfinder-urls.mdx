# Dynamic Wayfinder URLs

Wayfinder supports a `resolveUrl` method which generates dynamic redirect URLs to a target gateway based on the provided routing strategy. This function can be used to directly replace any hard-coded gateway URLs, and instead use Wayfinder's routing logic to select a gateway for the request.

### Dynamic routing for ArNS names

Given an ArNS name, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  arnsName: 'ardrive',
});
// results in https://ardrive.\<selected-gateway\>
```

### Dynamic routing for txIds

Given a txId, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  txId: 'example-tx-id',
});
// results in https://\<selected-gateway\>/example-tx-id
```

### Dynamic routing for legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URLs

Given a legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'https://arweave.net/example-tx-id',
});
// results in https://\<selected-gateway\>/example-tx-id
```

### Dynamic routing for ar:// URLs

Given an ar:// URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'ar://example-name/subpath?query=value',
});
// results in https://\<selected-gateway\>/example-name/subpath?query=value
```
