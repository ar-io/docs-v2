Verifies data integrity using SHA-256 hash comparison. This is the default verification strategy and is recommended for most users looking for a balance between security and performance.

```javascript
import { Wayfinder, HashVerificationStrategy } from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
  },
});
```
