description: "JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for accessing Arweave data with built-in verification and gateway routing"
---

Verifies signatures of Arweave transactions and data items. Headers are retrieved from trusted gateways for use during verification. For a transaction, its data root is computed while streaming its data and then utilized alongside its headers for verification. For data items, the ANS-104 deep hash method of signature verification is used.

```javascript
import { Wayfinder, SignatureVerificationStrategy } from '@ar-io/sdk';

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new SignatureVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
  },
});
```
