Verifies data integrity using Arweave by computing the data root for the transaction. This is useful for L1 transactions and is recommended for users who want to ensure the integrity of their data.

```javascript
import { Wayfinder, DataRootVerificationStrategy } from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new DataRootVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
  },
});
```
