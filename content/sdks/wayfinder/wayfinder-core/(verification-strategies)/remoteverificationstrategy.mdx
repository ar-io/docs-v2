title: "RemoteVerificationStrategy"
description: "JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for accessing Arweave data with built-in verification and gateway routing"
---

This strategy is used to verify data by checking the `x-ar-io-verified` header from the gateway that returned the data. If the header is set to `true`, the data is considered verified and trusted.

<Callout type="warn">
This strategy is only recommended for users fetching data from their own gateways and want to avoid the overhead of the other verification strategies.
</Callout>

```javascript
import { Wayfinder, RemoteVerificationStrategy } from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    // no trusted gateways are required for this strategy
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new RemoteVerificationStrategy(),
  },
});
```
