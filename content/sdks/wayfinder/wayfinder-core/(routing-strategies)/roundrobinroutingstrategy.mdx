Selects gateways in round-robin order. The gateway list is stored in memory and is not persisted across instances. You must provide either `gateways` OR `gatewaysProvider` (not both).

```javascript
import { RoundRobinRoutingStrategy, NetworkGatewaysProvider } from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';
import { ARIO } from '@ar.io/sdk';

// use with a static list of gateways
const routingStrategy = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
  gateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net'), new URL('https://permagate.io')],
});

// use with gatewaysProvider (loaded once and memoized)
const routingStrategy2 = new RoundRobinRoutingStrategy({
  gatewaysProvider: new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
    ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
    sortBy: 'operatorStake',
    sortOrder: 'desc',
    limit: 10,
  }),
});

const gateway = await routingStrategy.selectGateway(); // returns the next gateway in round-robin order
```
