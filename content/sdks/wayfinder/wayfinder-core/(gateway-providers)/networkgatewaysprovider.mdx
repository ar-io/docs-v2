Returns a list of gateways from the ARIO Network based on on-chain metrics. You can specify on-chain metrics for gateways to prioritize the highest quality gateways. This requires installing the `@ar.io/sdk` package and importing the `ARIO` object. *It is recommended to use this provider for most use cases to leverage the AR.IO Network.*

```javascript
// requests will be routed to one of the top 10 gateways by operator stake
const gatewayProvider = new NetworkGatewaysProvider({
  ario: ARIO.mainnet(),
  sortBy: 'operatorStake', // sort by 'operatorStake' | 'totalDelegatedStake'
  sortOrder: 'desc', // 'asc'
  limit: 10, // number of gateways to use
  filter: (gateway) => {
    // use only active gateways that did not fail in the last epoch
    return gateway.status === 'joined' && gateway.stats.failedConsecutiveEpochs === 0;
  },
});
```
