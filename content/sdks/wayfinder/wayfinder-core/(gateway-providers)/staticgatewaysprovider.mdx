The static gateway provider returns a list of gateways that you provide. This is useful for testing or for users who want to use a specific gateway for all requests.

```javascript
import { StaticGatewaysProvider } from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core';

const gatewayProvider = new StaticGatewaysProvider({
  gateways: ['https://arweave.net'],
});
```
