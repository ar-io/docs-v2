Given a legacy arweave.net or arweave.dev URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'https://arweave.net/example-tx-id',
});
// results in https://\<selected-gateway\>/example-tx-id
```
