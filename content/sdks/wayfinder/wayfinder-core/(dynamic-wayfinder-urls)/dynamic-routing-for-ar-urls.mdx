Given an ar:// URL, the redirect URL will be the same as the original URL, but with the gateway selected by Wayfinder's routing strategy.

```javascript
const redirectUrl = await wayfinder.resolveUrl({
  originalUrl: 'ar://example-name/subpath?query=value',
});
// results in https://\<selected-gateway\>/example-name/subpath?query=value
```
