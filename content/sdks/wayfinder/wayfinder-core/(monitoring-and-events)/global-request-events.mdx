Wayfinder emits events during the routing and verification process for all requests, allowing you to monitor its operation. All events are emitted on the `wayfinder.emitter` event emitter, and are updated for each request.

```javascript
// Provide events to the Wayfinder constructor for tracking all requests
const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  routingSettings: {
    events: {
      onRoutingStarted: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing started!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSkipped: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing skipped!', event);
      },
      onRoutingSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log('Routing succeeded!', event);
      },
    },
  },
  verificationSettings: {
    events: {
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Verification passed for transaction: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationFailed: (event) => {
        console.error(
          `Verification failed for transaction: ${event.txId}`,
          event.error,
        );
      },
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        const percentage = (event.processedBytes / event.totalBytes) * 100;
        console.log(
          `Verification progress for ${event.txId}: ${percentage.toFixed(2)}%`,
        );
      },
    },
  },
});

// listen to the global wayfinder event emitter for all requests
wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-succeeded', (event) => {
  console.log(`Request routed to: ${event.targetGateway}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('routing-failed', (event) => {
  console.error(`Routing failed: ${event.error.message}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-progress', (event) => {
  console.log(`Verification progress: ${event.progress}%`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-succeeded', (event) => {
  console.log(`Verification succeeded: ${event.txId}`);
});

wayfinder.emitter.on('verification-failed', (event) => {
  console.error(`Verification failed: ${event.error.message}`);
});
```
