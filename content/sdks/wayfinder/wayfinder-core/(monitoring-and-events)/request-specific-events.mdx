You can also provide events to the `request` function to track a single request. These events are called for each request and are not updated for subsequent requests.

> Note: events are still emitted to the global event emitter for all requests. It is recommended to use the global event emitter for tracking all requests, and the request-specific events for tracking a single request.

```javascript
// create a wayfinder instance with verification enabled
const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: new HashVerificationStrategy({
      trustedGateways: ['https://permagate.io'],
    }),
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Global callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
    },
  },
});

const response = await wayfinder.request('ar://example-name', {
  verificationSettings: {
    // these callbacks will be triggered for this request only, the global callback handlers are still called
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (event) => {
        console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (event) => {
        console.log(`Request-specific callback handler called for: ${event.txId}`);
      },
    },
  },
});
```
