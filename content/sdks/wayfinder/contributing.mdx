4. As you make commits/changes or once you're ready to release, create a changeset describing your changes via `npx changeset`.
5. Follow the prompts to select the packages that are affected by your changes.
6. Add and commit the changeset to your branch
7. Request review from a maintainer, and once approved, merge your changes into the `alpha` branch
8. A release PR will be automatically created with all pending changesets to the `alpha` branch
9. The maintainer will review the PR and merge it into `alpha`, which will trigger the automated release process using all pending changesets
