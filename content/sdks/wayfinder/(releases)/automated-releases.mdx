This repository is configured with GitHub Actions workflows that automate the release process:

- **Main Branch**: When changes are merged to `main`, a standard release is created
- **Alpha Branch**: When changes are merged to `alpha`, a prerelease (alpha tagged) is created

The workflow automatically:
1. Determines whether to create a prerelease or standard release based on the branch
2. Versions packages using changesets
3. Publishes to npm
4. Creates GitHub releases
5. Pushes tags back to the repository

To use the automated process:
1. Create changesets for your changes
2. Push your changes to a feature branch
3. Create a pull request to `alpha` (for prereleases) or `main` (for standard releases)
4. When the PR is merged, the release will be automatically created
