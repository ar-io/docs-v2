ArDrive uses a hierarchical structure:
- **Drives**: Top-level containers (public or private)
- **Folders**: Organize files within drives
- **Files**: Individual files stored on Arweave

Each entity has a unique ID (`DriveID`, `FolderID`, `FileID`) and can be either public (unencrypted) or private (encrypted).
