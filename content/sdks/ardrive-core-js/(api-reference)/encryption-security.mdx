#### Key Derivation

```typescript
import { deriveDriveKey, deriveFileKey } from 'ardrive-core-js';

// Derive drive key from password
const driveKey = await deriveDriveKey('myPassword', driveId.toString(), JSON.stringify(wallet.getPrivateKey()));

// File keys are automatically derived from drive keys
const fileKey = await deriveFileKey(driveKey, fileId);
```

#### Manual Encryption/Decryption

```typescript
import { driveEncrypt, driveDecrypt } from 'ardrive-core-js';

// Encrypt data
const { cipher, cipherIV } = await driveEncrypt(driveKey, data);

// Decrypt data
const decrypted = await driveDecrypt(cipherIV, driveKey, cipher);
```
