#### Creating Drives

```typescript
// Public drive
const publicDrive = await arDrive.createPublicDrive({
    driveName: 'My Public Drive'
});

// Private drive with password
const privateDrive = await arDrive.createPrivateDrive({
    driveName: 'My Private Drive',
    drivePassword: 'mySecretPassword'
});
```

#### Reading Drive Information

```typescript
// Get public drive
const publicDriveInfo = await arDrive.getPublicDrive({
    driveId
});

// Get private drive (requires drive key)
const privateDriveInfo = await arDrive.getPrivateDrive({
    driveId,
    driveKey
});

// Get all drives for an address
const allDrives = await arDrive.getAllDrivesForAddress({
    address: walletAddress,
    privateKeyData: wallet.getPrivateKey()
});
```

#### Renaming Drives

```typescript
// Rename public drive
await arDrive.renamePublicDrive({
    driveId,
    newName: 'Updated Drive Name'
});

// Rename private drive
await arDrive.renamePrivateDrive({
    driveId,
    driveKey,
    newName: 'Updated Private Name'
});
```
