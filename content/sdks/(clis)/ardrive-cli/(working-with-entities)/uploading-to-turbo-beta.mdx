Users can optionally choose to send each ArFS entities created to [ArDrive Turbo][ardrive-turbo] using the `--turbo` flag. Instead of using AR from an Arweave wallet, you can use Turbo Credits or take advantage of free/discounted upload promotions.

```shell
ardrive \<my-command\> \<other-options\> --turbo
```

This flag will skip any balance check on the CLI side. Turbo will check a user's balance and accept/reject a data item at the time of upload. The `--turbo` flag by default will send your files to `upload.ardrive.io` to be bundled. To change the Turbo destination, users can use the `--turbo-url` flag.
