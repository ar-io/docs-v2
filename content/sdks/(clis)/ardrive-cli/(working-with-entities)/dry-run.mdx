An important feature of the ArDrive CLI is the `--dry-run` flag. On each command that would write an ArFS entity, there is the option to run it as a "dry run". This will run all of the steps and print the outputs of a regular ArFS write, but will skip sending the actual transaction:

```shell
ardrive \<my-command\> \<other-options\> --dry-run
```

This can be very useful for gathering price estimations or to confirm that you've copy-pasted your entity IDs correctly before committing to an upload.
