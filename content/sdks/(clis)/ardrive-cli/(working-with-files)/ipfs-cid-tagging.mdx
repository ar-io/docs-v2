Certain nodes on the Arweave network may be running the [IPFS+Arweave bridge](https://arweave.medium.com/arweave-ipfs-persistence-for-the-interplanetary-file-system-9f12981c36c3). Tagging your file upload transaction with its IPFS v1 CID value in the 'IPFS-Add' tag may allow you to take advantage of this system. It can also be helpful for finding data on Arweave via GQL based on its CID. To include the CID tag on your **PUBLIC** file uploads, you may use the '--add-ipfs-tag' flag:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --add-ipfs-tag --local-path /path/to/file.txt  --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```
