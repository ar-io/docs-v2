To rename an on-chain file you can make use of the `rename-file` command. The required parameters are the file ID and the new name, as well as the owner wallet or seed phrase.

```shell
ardrive rename-file --file-id "290a3f9a-37b2-4f0f-a899-6fac983833b3" --file-name "My custom file name.txt" --wallet-file "wallet.json"
```
