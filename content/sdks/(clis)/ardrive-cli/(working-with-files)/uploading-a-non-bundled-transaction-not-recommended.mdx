title: "Uploading a Non-Bundled Transaction (NOT RECOMMENDED)"
description: "Command line interface for ArDrive"

While not recommended, the CLI does provide the option to forcibly send all transactions as standard transactions rather than attempting to bundle them together. To do this, simply add the `--no-bundle` flag to the `upload-file` or `create-drive` command:

```shell
ardrive upload-file --no-bundle --local-path /path/to/file --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```
