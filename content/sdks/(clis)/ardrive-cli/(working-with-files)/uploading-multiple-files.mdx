To upload an arbitrary number of files or folders, pass a space-separated list of paths to `--local-paths`:

```shell
ardrive upload-file -w wallet.json -F "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885" --local-paths ./image.png ~/backups/ ../another_file.txt

ardrive upload-file -w wallet.json -F "6939b9e0-cc98-42cb-bae0-5888eca78885" --local-paths ./*.json
```
