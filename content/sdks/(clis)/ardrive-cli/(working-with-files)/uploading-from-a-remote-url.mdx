title: "Uploading From a Remote URL"
description: "Command line interface for ArDrive"

You can upload a file from an existing url using the `--remote-path` flag. This must be used in conjunction with `--dest-file-name`.

You can use a custom content type using the `--content-type` flag, but if this isn't used the app will use the content type from the response header of the request for the remote data.

```shell
ardrive upload-file --remote-path "https://url/to/file" --parent-folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" -d "example.jpg" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```
