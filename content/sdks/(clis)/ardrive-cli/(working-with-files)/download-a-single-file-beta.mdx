By using the `download-file` command you can download a file on chain to a folder in your local storage specified by --local-path (or to your current working directory if not specified):

```shell
ardrive download-file -w /path/to/wallet.json --file-id "ff450770-a9cb-46a5-9234-89cbd9796610" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/
```

Specify a filename in the --local-path if you'd like to use a different name than the one that's used in your drive:

```shell
ardrive download-file -w /path/to/wallet.json --file-id "ff450770-a9cb-46a5-9234-89cbd9796610" --local-path /my_ardrive_downloads/my_pic.png
```
