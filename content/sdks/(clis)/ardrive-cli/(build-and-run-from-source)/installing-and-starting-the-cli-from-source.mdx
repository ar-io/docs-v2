Now that your runtime and/or development environment is set up, to install the package simply run:

```shell
yarn && yarn build
```

And then start the CLI (always from the root of this repository):

```shell
yarn ardrive
```

For convenience in the **non-developer case**, you can install the CLI globally on your system by performing the following step:

```shell
yarn pack

npm install i -g /path/to/package.tgz

ardrive
```
