Moving a folder is as simple as supplying a new parent folder ID. Note that naming collisions among entities within a folder are not allowed.

```shell
ardrive move-folder --folder-id "9af694f6-4cfc-4eee-88a8-1b02704760c0" --parent-folder-id "29850ab7-56d4-4e1f-a5be-cb86d5513921" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```
