Creating folders manually is straightforward:

```shell
ardrive create-folder --parent-folder-id "63153bb3-2ca9-4d42-9106-0ce82e793321" --folder-name "My Awesome Folder" -w /path/to/wallet.json
```

Example output:

```shell
{
    "created": [
        {
            "type": "folder",
            "metadataTxId": "AYFMBVmwqhbg9y5Fbj3Iasy5oxUqhauOW7PcS1sl4Dk",
            "entityId": "d1b7c514-fb12-4603-aad8-002cf63015d3",
            "key": "yHdCjpCKD2cuhQcKNx2d/XF5ReEjoKfZVqKunlCnPEk",
            "entityName": "My Awesome Folder"
        }
    ],
    "tips": [],
    "fees": {
        "AYFMBVmwqhbg9y5Fbj3Iasy5oxUqhauOW7PcS1sl4Dk": 1378052
    }
}
```

Note: Folders can also be created by supplying a folder as the --local-path of an upload-file command. In this case, the folder hierarchy on the local disk will be reconstructed on chain during the course of the recursive bulk upload.
