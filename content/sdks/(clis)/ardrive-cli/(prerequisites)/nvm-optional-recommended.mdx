This project uses the Node Version Manager (NVM) and an `.nvmrc` file to lock the recommended Node version used by the latest version of `ardrive-core-js`.

**Note for Windows: We recommend using WSL for setting up NVM on Windows using the [instructions described here][wsl-install]**

Follow these steps to get NVM up and running on your system:

1. Install NVM using [these installation instructions][nvm-install].
2. Navigate to this project's root directory
3. Ensure that the correct version of Node is installed by performing: `nvm install`
4. Use the correct version of Node, by performing: `nvm use`

**IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU AVOID GENERATING WALLETS VIA SEED PHRASE WITH THE CLI USING ANY NODE VERSION OTHER THAN THE ONE SPECIFIED IN `.nvmrc`.**
