Data uploaded via the ArDrive CLI, once indexed by Arweave's Gateways and sufficiently seeded across enough nodes on the network, can be accessed via all other ArDrive applications including the [ArDrive Web application][ardrive-web-app] at https://app.ardrive.io.

All transactions successfully executed by ArDrive can always be inspected in the [Viewblock blockchain explorer].
