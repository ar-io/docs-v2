title: "Using a Custom Arweave Gateway"
description: "Command line interface for ArDrive"

On each command that uses a gateway, it is possible to supply your own custom Arweave gateway using the flag `--gateway` or by setting an environment variable named `ARWEAVE_GATEWAY`.

For example, you could test out that your ArFS transactions are working as expected on a local test network such as [ArLocal] with this flow:

```shell
npx arlocal

curl http://localhost:1984/mint/{ your public wallet address }/99999999999999

ardrive create-drive --gateway http://127.0.0.1:1984 -w /path/to/wallet -n 'my-test-drive'

export ARWEAVE_GATEWAY="http://localhost:1984"

curl "$ARWEAVE_GATEWAY/mine"

ardrive upload-file -F { root folder id from create drive } -l /path/to/file -w /path/to/wallet

curl "$ARWEAVE_GATEWAY/mine"

ardrive list-drive -d { drive id from create drive }

ardrive download-file -f { file id from upload file }
```
