description: "Quick guide to configuring your AR.IO Gateway to process specific types of data using filters"
---

Configure your AR.IO Gateway to process only the data you need. By default, gateways process no bundles or data items - you must explicitly enable filtering to start processing data.

## The Basics

Your gateway uses **two main filters** to control data processing:

1. **`ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER`** - Controls which bundles get processed
2. **`ANS104_INDEX_FILTER`** - Controls which data items get indexed for querying

Both filters are set in your `.env` file as JSON strings.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Choose Your Filter Strategy

    **Process everything:**
    ```bash
    ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER='{"always": true}'
    ANS104_INDEX_FILTER='{"always": true}'
    ```

    **Process nothing (default):**
    ```bash
    ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER='{"never": true}'
    ANS104_INDEX_FILTER='{"never": true}'
    ```

    **Process specific app data:**
    ```bash
    # Process only your app's data
    ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER='{"tags": [{"name": "App-Name", "valueStartsWith": "MyApp"}]}'
    ANS104_INDEX_FILTER='{"tags": [{"name": "App-Name", "valueStartsWith": "MyApp"}]}'
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Apply Your Configuration

    1. **Edit your `.env` file** with your chosen filters
    2. **Restart your gateway** to apply changes:
       ```bash
       docker compose down
       docker compose up -d
       ```
    3. **Monitor your logs** to see processing activity

## Common Filter Examples

<Tabs items={['App Name', 'Content Type', 'Owner Address', 'Multiple Conditions']}>
  <Tab value="App Name">
    Use the App-Name tags from your uploaded data. For example, if you're using `MyApp-v1.0` as your App-Name:

    ```json
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "App-Name",
          "value": "MyApp-v1.0"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Or filter for all versions of your app:

    ```json
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "App-Name",
          "valueStartsWith": "MyApp"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Content Type">
    ```json
    {
      "tags": [
        {
          "name": "Content-Type",
          "valueStartsWith": "image/"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Owner Address">
    ```json
    {
      "attributes": {
        "owner_address": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Multiple Conditions">
    ```json
    {
      "and": [
        {
          "tags": [
            {
              "name": "App-Name",
              "valueStartsWith": "MyApp"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "attributes": {
            "owner_address": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Important Notes

- **Filters are JSON strings** - must be properly formatted
- **Restart required** - changes only take effect after restart
- **Start simple** - begin with basic filters and refine over time
- **Monitor resources** - processing data uses CPU, memory, and storage

## Quick Troubleshooting

**Gateway not processing data?**

- Check your filters are valid JSON
- Ensure `ANS104_UNBUNDLE_WORKERS=1` is set
- Restart your gateway after changes

**Too much data being processed?**

- Use more restrictive filters
- Consider excluding common bundlers
- Monitor your system resources
