Get your AR.IO gateway running in **30 seconds** with Docker. No configuration needed - just run and test.

## Prerequisites

**You'll need Docker installed on your system.**

- **Install Docker** - Follow the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your platform

## How to Get Started Running Your Own AR.IO Gateway

**Run a gateway with one command:**

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v ar-io-data:/app/data ghcr.io/ar-io/ar-io-core:latest
```

**What this does:**

- **Pulls the image** - Downloads the pre-built AR.IO gateway from GitHub Container Registry
- **Creates a container** - Runs the gateway in an isolated environment
- **Maps port 4000** - Makes the gateway accessible on your local machine
- **Creates data volume** - Persists gateway data between restarts

**That's it!** Your gateway is now running on `localhost:4000`.

## Test Your Gateway

**Verify it's working:**

```bash
curl localhost:4000/agYcCFJtrMG6cqMuZfskIkFTGvUPddICmtQSBIoPdiA
```

**Expected output:**

```
1984
```

If you see `1984`, your gateway is working perfectly!

## What Just Happened?

### Docker Command Breakdown

- **`docker run`** - Start a new container
- **`-p 4000:4000`** - Map port 4000 from container to host
- **`-v ar-io-data:/app/data`** - Create persistent data volume
- **`ghcr.io/ar-io/ar-io-core:latest`** - AR.IO gateway image

### Gateway Features

Your local gateway now provides:

- **HTTP access** to Arweave data
- **Data caching** for faster retrieval
- **Basic indexing** capabilities
- **ArNS routing** support

## Accessing Data

**Basic data access:**

```bash
# Access any Arweave transaction
curl localhost:4000/<transaction-id>

# Example with a real transaction
curl localhost:4000/bVLEkL1SOPFCzIYi8T_QNnh17VlDp4RylU6YTwCMVRw
```

**ArNS domain access:**

```bash
# Access via ArNS names (if configured)
curl localhost:4000/myapp.arweave.net
```

## Gateway Health Check

**Check if your gateway is healthy:**

```bash
# Basic health check
curl localhost:4000/health

# More detailed status
curl localhost:4000/status
```

## Stopping Your Gateway

**Stop the gateway:**

```bash
# Find the container ID
docker ps

# Stop the container
docker stop <container-id>
```

**Remove the container:**

```bash
docker rm <container-id>
```

**Keep your data:**
The `ar-io-data` volume persists, so your cached data remains available when you restart.

## Restarting Your Gateway

**Start again with the same data:**

```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v ar-io-data:/app/data ghcr.io/ar-io/ar-io-core:latest
```

Your previously cached data will be available immediately.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Use a different port
docker run -p 4001:4000 -v ar-io-data:/app/data ghcr.io/ar-io/ar-io-core:latest

# Then test with
curl localhost:4001/agYcCFJtrMG6cqMuZfskIkFTGvUPddICmtQSBIoPdiA
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Run with proper permissions
docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -p 4000:4000 -v ar-io-data:/app/data ghcr.io/ar-io/ar-io-core:latest
```

### Check Logs

```bash
# View gateway logs
docker logs <container-id>

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f <container-id>
```

## What's Next?

**Your gateway is running locally!** Now you can:

1. **Test with different data** - try various Arweave transaction IDs
2. **Explore ArNS** - set up friendly domain names
3. **Scale up** - move to [Expanding Your Gateway](/running-your-own-infrastructure/expanding-your-gateway) for production
