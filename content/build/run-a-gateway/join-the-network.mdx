Take control of the permanent web by running your own **AR.IO Gateway**. Join the decentralized network that powers the permaweb and earn rewards for providing infrastructure services.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Running Gateway Required

    You must have a fully functional AR.IO Gateway running with a custom domain and SSL certificates. 
    
    **Don't have a gateway yet?** Follow our [Production Setup Guide](/build/run-a-gateway/quick-start#production-setup-with-custom-domain) to get your gateway running with proper DNS configuration.

    **Requirements:**
    - Gateway accessible via your custom domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
    - SSL certificates properly configured
    - ArNS subdomain resolution working
    - Gateway responding to test requests
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Join the Network

Choose your preferred method to register your gateway:

<Tabs items={['Network Portal', 'CLI']}>
  <Tab value="Network Portal">
    <Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Visit the Network Portal

    Go to [gateways.ar.io](https://gateways.ar.io/#/gateways) to access the AR.IO Network Portal.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <img src="/join-1.png" alt="Network Portal" className="max-w-md rounded-lg" />
    </div>
    
    The portal shows all active gateways on the network and provides the interface to register your own gateway.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Connect Your Wallet

    Click the "Start your own gateway" button to begin the registration process. You'll be prompted to connect your wallet.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <img src="/join-2.png" alt="Connect Wallet" className="max-w-md rounded-lg" />
    </div>

    Choose your preferred wallet (Wander, Metamask, or Beacon) to connect.

    <Callout type="warning" title="Wallet Address Requirement">
      Use the same wallet address that you configured in your gateway's `AR_IO_WALLET` environment variable. This wallet will be the owner of your gateway registration.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Fill Out Gateway Information

    Complete the gateway registration form with your gateway details:

    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <img src="/join-3.png" alt="Gateway Registration Form" className="max-w-md rounded-lg" />
    </div>

    **Required Fields:**
    - **Label**: A display name for your gateway (e.g., "My New Gateway")
    - **Address**: Your gateway's domain with port (e.g., `https://fastandfurious.io:443`)
    - **Observer Wallet**: The public address of your observer wallet
    - **Properties ID**: Transaction ID of your gateway properties
    - **Stake (ARIO)**: Minimum stake required (typically 10,000 ARIO)
    - **Delegated Staking**: Enable to allow others to delegate stake to your gateway
    - **Minimum Delegated Stake**: Set minimum delegation amount (e.g., 100 ARIO)
    - **Reward Share Ratio**: Percentage of rewards shared with delegators (e.g., 50%)
    - **Note**: Additional information about your gateway (e.g., "AR.IO rules!")
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Confirm Registration

    Review all information carefully and click "Confirm" to submit your gateway registration to the network.

    **What happens next:**
    - Your gateway will be added to the Gateway Address Registry
    - Observers will start observing your gateway at the next Epoch (day)
    - You will begin to receive rewards based on your gateway performance
    - You can monitor your gateway's performance in the portal

    **Confirm your gateway registration:**

    Your gateway should now be viewable at `gateways.ar.io/#/<ar-io-wallet-address>` with the wallet address you used to join.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
      <img src="/join-4.png" alt="Gateway Dashboard" className="max-w-lg rounded-lg" />
    </div>

    This dashboard shows your gateway's information, stats, and performance metrics including join date, uptime, operator stake, and delegated stake details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="CLI">
    <Steps>
      <Step>
        ### Install the AR.IO CLI

        First, install the AR.IO CLI tool if you haven't already:

        ```npm
        npm install -g @ar.io/sdk
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Run the Join Network Command

        Use the `ar.io join-network` command with your gateway configuration:

        ```bash
        ar.io join-network \
          --wallet-file ./path/to/wallet.json \
          --qty 10000000000 \
          --auto-stake true \
          --allow-delegated-staking true \
          --min-delegated-stake 100000000 \
          --delegate-reward-share-ratio 10 \
          --label "My Test Gateway" \
          --note "Test gateway for development" \
          --observer-wallet 0VE0wIhDy90WiQoV3U2PeY44FH1aVetOoulPGqgYukj \
          --fqdn my-gateway.example.com \
          --port 443 \
          --protocol https \
          --mainnet
        ```

        <Callout type="warning" title="Wallet File Requirement">
          The wallet file used in the `--wallet-file` parameter must be the same wallet configured in your AR.IO Gateway's `AR_IO_WALLET` environment variable. This ensures your gateway registration is properly linked to your running gateway instance.
        </Callout>

        **Parameter explanations:**
        - `--qty 10000000000` - 10,000 ARIO in mARIO (multiply by 1,000,000)
        - `--min-delegated-stake 100000000` - 100 ARIO in mARIO
        - `--delegate-reward-share-ratio 10` - 10% shared with delegators
        - `--observer-wallet` - Must match your gateway's OBSERVER_WALLET env var
        - `--fqdn` - Your gateway's domain name
      </Step>

      <Step>
        ### Verify Registration

        After running the command, verify your gateway registration using the CLI:

        ```bash
        ar.io get-gateway 0VE0wIhDy90WiQoV3U2PeY44FH1aVetOoulPGqgYukj
        ```

        The status should show `joined` when your gateway is successfully registered.

        You can also verify by visiting: `gateways.ar.io/#/<your-wallet-address>`

        The CLI will output transaction details and your gateway should appear in the network portal within a few minutes.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What Happens After Registration

After joining the network:

- Your gateway will be monitored by the Observer system
- You'll earn rewards for providing reliable service
- You can monitor your gateway's performance and earnings in the portal
- You may be selected as an Observer to help monitor other gateways
