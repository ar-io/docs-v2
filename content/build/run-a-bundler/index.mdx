description: "Learn how to run your own AR.IO bundler infrastructure for efficient data packaging and submission to Arweave"
---

Take control of data bundling by running your own **AR.IO Bundler**. Package and submit data efficiently to the Arweave network using ANS-104 bundling standards.

## What is a Bundler?

**AR.IO Bundlers** package multiple data items into efficient bundles and submit them to Arweave, reducing costs and improving reliability compared to individual transactions.

## Deployment Options

**AR.IO Bundlers can be deployed in two ways:**

- **Standalone** - Run independently using [Turbo Upload Service](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-upload-service)
- **Gateway Extension** - Integrate with your AR.IO gateway using docker-compose.bundler.yaml

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your system

**Standalone bundler:**

```bash
# Clone and start Turbo Upload Service
git clone https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-upload-service.git
cd turbo-upload-service
docker compose up upload-service
```

**Gateway extension:**

```bash
# Clone and start as gateway extension
git clone https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-node.git
cd ar-io-node
docker compose -f docker-compose.bundler.yaml up
```

## Ready to Bundle?

**Start with the basics** - understand what bundlers do and why they matter.
