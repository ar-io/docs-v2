# Bundler as Gateway Extension

Integrate your AR.IO bundler with an existing gateway to provide **combined data serving and bundling services**.

## What is a Gateway Extension?

**Gateway Extensions** (formerly "sidecars") are additional services that run alongside your AR.IO gateway:

- **Bundling services** - Package and submit data
- **Unified interface** - Single endpoint for all operations
- **Shared resources** - Use gateway infrastructure
- **Simplified management** - One service to maintain

## Quick Setup

**Prerequisites:**

- **Docker Compose** - For service orchestration
- **AR.IO Node Repository** - [github.com/ar-io/ar-io-node](https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-node)

**Use the existing docker-compose.bundler.yaml:**

```bash
# Clone the AR.IO node repository
git clone https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-node.git
cd ar-io-node

# Start the bundler as gateway extension
docker compose -f docker-compose.bundler.yaml up
```

**The existing docker-compose.bundler.yaml includes:**

- Gateway service
- Bundler service
- PostgreSQL database
- MinIO object storage
- All necessary networking and dependencies

## Service Communication

**Gateway forwards upload requests to bundler:**

- `POST /upload` - Forward to bundler
- `GET /upload/{id}/status` - Check upload status
- `GET /upload/{id}/result` - Get upload result

**Bundler uses gateway for data serving:**

- Uses gateway for data retrieval
- Shared infrastructure resources
- Unified API endpoints

## Configuration

**The docker-compose.bundler.yaml is pre-configured with:**

- **Gateway settings** - Optimized for bundler integration
- **Bundler settings** - Ready-to-use whitelist and payment configuration
- **Database setup** - PostgreSQL with proper schemas
- **Object storage** - MinIO for data persistence
- **Networking** - Services communicate internally

**Key environment variables you may want to customize:**

- **`WHITELIST_WALLETS`** - Comma-separated wallet addresses
- **`ARWEAVE_WALLET`** - JWK for bundle signing
- **`DATABASE_URL`** - PostgreSQL connection string
- **`S3_*`** - Object storage credentials
