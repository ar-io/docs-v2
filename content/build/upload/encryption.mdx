**Arweave has no built-in encryption.** All encryption and decryption must be handled client-side before uploading data to the network. Arweave is completely data-agnostic - it stores whatever data you provide without any knowledge of whether it's encrypted or not.

## How Encryption Works on Arweave

**Critical Points:**

- **No native encryption**: Arweave provides no encryption services whatsoever
- **Client-side only**: You must encrypt data before uploading
- **Data-agnostic storage**: Arweave stores any data type, including encrypted data
- **Your responsibility**: You handle all encryption, key management, and decryption
- **Permanent security**: Once encrypted and stored, data remains secure forever

## Encryption Options

### 1. Manual Client-Side Encryption

Encrypt your data before uploading with Turbo:

```js
import CryptoJS from "crypto-js";

// Encrypt sensitive data
const data = "Sensitive information";
const secretKey = "your-secret-key";
const encryptedData = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(data, secretKey).toString();

// Upload encrypted data
const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: encryptedData,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/octet-stream" },
      { name: "Encrypted", value: "true" },
      { name: "Cipher", value: "AES-256-GCM" },
      { name: "Cipher-IV", value: "YWJjZGVmZ2hpams=" }, // 12 byte initialization vector as Base64
    ],
  },
});
```

## Encryption Standards

### Encryption Methods

- **AES-256-GCM**: Authenticated encryption (recommended)
- **AES-256-CTR**: Stream cipher for large files
- **Any encryption method**: Arweave supports any encryption you choose (must be indicated in `Cipher` tag for ArFS compliance)

### Required Tags

When uploading encrypted data, include these tags:

```js
{
  name: "Content-Type",
  value: "application/octet-stream"  // Required for encrypted data
},
{
  name: "Cipher",
  value: "AES-256-GCM"  // Specify encryption method
},
{
  name: "Cipher-IV",
  value: "base64-encoded-iv"  // Initialization vector
}
```

## ArFS Protocol (Optional Standardization)

The [Arweave File System (ArFS)](/build/advanced/arfs) protocol provides optional standardization for encrypted storage:

- **Private Drives**: Encrypt entire file systems
- **File-level encryption**: Each file has its own encryption key
- **Selective sharing**: Share individual files without exposing the entire drive
- **Key derivation**: Uses HKDF-SHA256 with wallet signatures
- **Completely optional**: You can use any encryption method you prefer

<Callout type="info">
  **ArDrive Web App:** Data uploaded through the ArDrive web app to Private
  Drives is encrypted for you using the standards set in the ArFS protocol.
  ArDrive is simply a web application that implements ArFS - there is no
  separate "ArDrive Encryption Service."
</Callout>

  and private drive management, see our detailed [ArFS Privacy & Encryption
  documentation](/build/advanced/arfs/privacy).

## Getting Started

<Tabs items={['ArDrive Web App', 'Manual Encryption']}>
  <Tab value="ArDrive Web App">
    For most users, the ArDrive web app provides the easiest way to encrypt and store data using ArFS standards:

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        **Create a private drive** in the ArDrive web app
      </Step>
      <Step>
        **Set a strong password** for your drive
      </Step>
      <Step>
        **Upload files** - they're automatically encrypted using ArFS
      </Step>
      <Step>
        **Access files** using your password and wallet
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Manual Encryption">
    For developers who need custom encryption:

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        **Choose an encryption library** (Crypto-JS, Web Crypto API)
      </Step>
      <Step>
        **Encrypt your data** before uploading
      </Step>
      <Step>
        **Add proper tags** to indicate encryption
      </Step>
      <Step>
        **Store keys securely** for decryption
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Never store encryption keys in your code or public
  repositories. Use secure key management practices and consider hardware
  security modules for production applications.
</Callout>

**Best Practices:**

- Use strong, randomly generated keys
- Implement proper key rotation
- Store keys securely (not in code)
- Use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM)
- Validate data integrity after decryption
