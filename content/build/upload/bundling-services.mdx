Upload data to Arweave using **Turbo** - the most reliable way to upload data to Arweave. Turbo provides enterprise-grade infrastructure with flexible payment options and optimized performance.

## What is Turbo?

Turbo is a ultrahigh-throughput Permaweb service that streamlines the funding, indexing, and transmission of data to and from Arweave. It provides graphical and programmatic interfaces for payment options in fiat currency with credit or debit cards as well as cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, USDC, and AR. It integrates two key components: a service that bundles uploads for efficiency and ease, and a payment system designed for straightforward transactions. Turbo Credits, which users can purchase within the ArDrive web app, the [Turbo Top Up App](https://turbo-topup.com/), or by using the [Turbo SDK/CLI](/sdks/turbo-sdk), have the same storage purchasing power of AR tokens, along with the additional benefits provided by Turbo. These credits are meticulously calibrated, with the Winston Credit (winc) representing the smallest unit, ensuring users have precise control over their storage needs. As an open-source technology, Turbo encourages community engagement, allowing developers to contribute to its continuous enhancement.

## Get Started

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install the SDK

```bash
npm install @ardrive/turbo-sdk
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Set Up Your Wallet

Create a new wallet or use an existing one:

```bash
# Create a new wallet (easy way)
npx permaweb/wallet > key.json
```

Then load it in your code:

```js
import { TurboFactory, ArweaveSigner } from "@ardrive/turbo-sdk";
import fs from "fs";

// Load your wallet
const jwk = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./key.json", "utf-8"));
const signer = new ArweaveSigner(jwk);

// Initialize Turbo
const turbo = TurboFactory.authenticated({ signer });
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Get Turbo Credits

Purchase Turbo Credits to pay for uploads. When you upload, credits are automatically used and Turbo handles the payment to Arweave.

**Option 1: Via the Web Interface**

- Go to [turbo-topup.com](https://turbo-topup.com)
- Pay with fiat currencies (credit cards) or crypto tokens (ARIO, USDC, SOL, MATIC, AR)

**Option 2: Via the SDK**

```js
// Purchase credits programmatically
const fundResult = await turbo.topUpWithTokens({
  tokenAmount: TOKEN_AMOUNT,
  tokenType: "solana", // or 'ethereum', 'matic', 'arweave'
});
```

**Check Your Balance**

```js
const balance = await turbo.getBalance();
console.log(`Balance: ${balance.winc} Winston Credits`);
```

</Step>

<Step>
### Upload Your Data

<CodeGroup>
```js tab="Upload File"
const fileData = fs.readFileSync("./myfile.jpg");

const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: fileData,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "image/jpeg" },
      { name: "Title", value: "My Image" },
    ],
  },
});

console.log("Upload ID:", result.id);
console.log("Owner:", result.owner);

````

```js tab="Upload Folder"
const folderResult = await turbo.uploadFolder({
  folderPath: "./my-folder",
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Bundle-Format", value: "binary" },
      { name: "Bundle-Version", value: "2.0.0" },
    ],
  },
});

console.log("Folder Upload ID:", folderResult.id);
console.log("Manifest ID:", folderResult.manifestId);
````

```js tab="Upload Raw Data"
const data = JSON.stringify({
  message: "Hello Arweave!",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});

const result = await turbo.upload({
  data: data,
  dataItemOpts: {
    tags: [
      { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" },
      { name: "App-Name", value: "MyApp" },
    ],
  },
});

console.log("Upload ID:", result.id);
console.log("Owner:", result.owner);
```
