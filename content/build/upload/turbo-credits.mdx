Turbo Credits are the payment medium used by Turbo's upload service, providing a 1:1 conversion from Arweave's native AR token with additional benefits and flexible payment options.

## What are Turbo Credits?

Turbo Credits represent upload power on the Arweave network, divisible down to 1 trillionth of a credit (Winston Credit). Unlike traditional crypto tokens, Turbo Credits cannot be traded, transferred, or exchanged - they exist solely for uploading data to Arweave.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** Turbo Credits are non-refundable and cannot be withdrawn or
  exchanged for other cryptocurrencies.
