title: "EthAReum Protocol"
description: "Generate Arweave wallets deterministically from Ethereum or Solana wallets"
---

The **EthAReum protocol** enables the generation of private keys for an Arweave wallet using a signature from an Ethereum or Solana wallet. This allows users to create an Arweave wallet directly through popular wallet providers like MetaMask, providing seamless cross-chain wallet management.

Generated private keys provide a fully functional Arweave wallet, equipped to perform all standard operations, including holding AR tokens and Turbo Credits, and uploading data to the Arweave network.

## How It Works

EthAReum uses a deterministic key derivation process that combines:

- **Ethereum/Solana wallet signature** - Provides the cryptographic foundation
- **User-generated password** - Adds additional entropy and security
- **Standardized derivation algorithm** - Ensures reproducible results

The protocol generates a unique Arweave wallet that is cryptographically linked to your Ethereum or Solana wallet but remains completely independent.

## Browser Compatibility

<Callout type="warning">
  **Recommended Browser**: For optimal performance, use **Chrome** when working
  with EthAReum and MetaMask. While EthAReum functions correctly in most
  browsers, there are ongoing efforts to resolve some edge case compatibility
  issues in other environments.
</Callout>

## Password Security

The EthAReum protocol incorporates a user-generated password in the wallet derivation process. This password provides an extra layer of security by contributing additional entropy to the wallet's derivation and serves as a critical verification step for wallet access.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Permanent Password**: The password used during the derivation of private
  keys is **permanent and cannot be changed or recovered** by any administrator.
  ArDrive is a decentralized platform with no account administration. It is
  crucial to keep this password secure.
</Callout>

### Password Requirements

- Must be set during initial wallet creation
- Used for all subsequent logins
- Required for encrypting private uploads
- Cannot be recovered if forgotten

## Wallet Addresses

The public address of the generated Arweave wallet is derived from its public key and will be **different** from the public address of the Ethereum or Solana wallet used to generate it.

### Viewing Your Address

The exact steps to obtain your generated wallet's public address depend on the dApp interface:

- **ArDrive**: Click the user profile icon in the top right when logged in
- **Other dApps**: Check the wallet settings or profile section

## Key Management

### Keyfiles vs Seed Phrases

The Arweave ecosystem primarily uses **keyfiles** rather than seed phrases for wallet access:

- **Keyfile**: JSON file containing a Json Web Key (JWK) that acts as private keys
- **Seed Phrase**: Supported but not universally implemented across all dApps

<Callout type="info">
  **Keyfile Security**: Always treat your keyfile with the same care as you
  would private keys for an Ethereum wallet. Learn more about keyfiles in the
  [Arweave Cookbook](https://cookbook.arweave.dev/).
</Callout>

### Accessing Your Keys

Both keyfile and seed phrase are available for download in most dApps:

- **ArDrive**: Click the user profile icon in the top right when logged in
- **Other dApps**: Check wallet settings or export options

## Security Considerations

### One-Way Control

EthAReum generates Arweave wallet private keys using a signature from your Ethereum/Solana wallet, ensuring that control only extends in one direction:

- ✅ **EthAReum can generate** Arweave wallets from Ethereum/Solana signatures
- ❌ **EthAReum cannot access** your Ethereum/Solana wallet or assets
- ✅ **Your Ethereum/Solana assets remain** completely secure and independent

### Signature Security

<Callout type="warning">
  **Beware of Malicious dApps**: Some malicious dApps or websites may disguise
  high-risk authorization transactions as simple signature requests. Always
  ensure that you only provide signatures to reputable and trusted dApps like
  ArDrive.
</Callout>

### Best Practices

1. **Verify dApp authenticity** before providing signatures
2. **Use strong, unique passwords** for wallet derivation
3. **Backup your keyfile** in a secure location
4. **Never share your password** or keyfile with anyone
5. **Test with small amounts** before committing to large transactions

## Implementation Examples

### Basic Wallet Generation

```javascript
// Example: Generate Arweave wallet from Ethereum signature
async function generateArweaveWallet(ethereumSignature, password) {
  // This is a conceptual example - actual implementation
  // would use the EthAReum protocol specification

  const derivedKey = await deriveKeyFromSignature(
    ethereumSignature,
    password,
    "arweave" // derivation context
  );

  return {
    address: getAddressFromKey(derivedKey),
    keyfile: createKeyfile(derivedKey),
    seedPhrase: generateSeedPhrase(derivedKey),
  };
}
```

### Integration with MetaMask

```javascript
// Example: Request signature from MetaMask
async function requestEthereumSignature() {
  const accounts = await ethereum.request({
    method: "eth_requestAccounts",
  });

  const message = "Sign this message to generate your Arweave wallet";
  const signature = await ethereum.request({
    method: "personal_sign",
    params: [message, accounts[0]],
  });

  return signature;
}
```

## Use Cases
