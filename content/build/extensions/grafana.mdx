## Overview

Deploy a Grafana sidecar to visualize your gateway's performance and operation metrics. This monitoring solution provides real-time dashboards to track gateway health and performance.

## Deploying Grafana

<Steps>
<Step>
### Deploy the Grafana Container

The file that controls the deployment of the Grafana sidecar is `docker-compose.grafana.yaml`. So to deploy Grafana, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml up -d
```

The `-f` flag is used to specify the path to the docker-compose file, and the `up -d` flag is used to deploy the container in detached mode.

<Callout type="info" title="Terminal Location">
  This command assumes that you are running the command from the root directory
  of the gateway. If you are running the command from a different directory, you
  will need to adjust the path to the docker-compose file.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Check the Logs

To check the logs of the Grafana sidecar, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml logs -f --tail=25
```

The `-f` flag is used to follow the logs, and the `--tail=25` flag is used to specify the number of lines to show from the end of the logs, in this case 25.

Exit the logs by pressing `Ctrl+C`.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Nginx (Optional)

The Grafana sidecar is deployed on the same network as the gateway, and can be accessed in a browser by navigating to `http://localhost:1024` from the machine running the gateway.
In order to be able to access Grafana from outside the network running the gateway, Nginx, which is already used to route gateway traffic, can be configured to route Grafana traffic to the correct port.

In any editor, open the relevant Nginx configuration file. If the setup guide configuration was used, that file will be located at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`.

Add the following block to the configuration file inside the server block for https (443) traffic:

```nginx
    location /grafana/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:1024/grafana/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
```

The full configuration file should look like this:

```nginx
# force redirects http to https
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name <domain> *.<domain>;

    location / {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    }
}


# forwards traffic into your node and provides ssl certificates
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;
    server_name <domain> *.<domain>;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/privkey.pem;



    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;

        # Forward AR.IO headers if present in the request
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin $http_x_ar_io_origin;
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Origin-Node-Release $http_x_ar_io_origin_node_release;
        proxy_set_header X-AR-IO-Hops $http_x_ar_io_hops;
    }

    location /grafana/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:1024/grafana/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

}

```

Be sure to replace `<domain>` with the domain of the gateway.

Once the configuration is saved, test the configuration by running the following command:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
```

This will print out a message indicating that the configuration is valid.

Then, restart Nginx by running the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Once this is done, Grafana can be accessed by navigating to `https://<domain>/grafana` in a browser.

</Step>

<Step>
### Access Grafana

To access Grafana, navigate to `https://<domain>/grafana` in a browser.

The default credentials are:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

Once logged in for the first time, you will be prompted to change the password.

<Callout type="warning" title="Credential Reset">
  Updated credentials may be lost if the Grafana sidecar is restarted. Be sure
  to log into Grafana immediately after every start up to ensure Grafana cannot
  be accessed with the default credentials.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting Permission Errors

In some cases, the Grafana sidecar may encounter permission errors. There are two primary solutions to this issue:

### Modify Directory Permissions

The simplest solution is to modify the permissions of the directory that contains the Grafana data.

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 ./data/grafana
```

This will give the `grafana` user ownership of the directory and all its contents.

<Callout type="info" title="Terminal Location">
  This command assumes that you are running the command from the root directory
  of the gateway. If you are running the command from a different directory, you
  will need to adjust the path to the docker-compose file.
</Callout>

Check the logs again to ensure that the issue is resolved.

### Change the Grafana User

The second solution is to change the user that Grafana runs as. This can be done by modifying the `docker-compose.grafana.yaml` file to use a different user. It is suggested to use "root" or "0" to ensure that the container has the necessary permissions.

In any editor, open the `docker-compose.grafana.yaml` file and add "user: root" to the `grafana` service.

```yaml
grafana:
  image: grafana/grafana:latest
  user: root
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
```

Once this is done, restart the Grafana sidecar by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.grafana.yaml restart
```

Check the logs again to ensure that the issue is resolved.

## Dashboards

The Grafana sidecar comes preloaded with three dashboards:

- **ar-io-node**: Contains general gateway metrics, like the last block indexed, ArNS resolution times, and CPU usage.
- **ar-io-node bundle indexing**: Contains metrics related to bundle indexing, like the number of bundles and data items indexed.
- **ar-io-node queue lengths**: Contains metrics related to the queue lengths of the gateway, like Arweave Client requests and transaction importer data.

Additional dashboards can be added in order to monitor different aspects of the gateway.

The Grafana landing page contains tutorials for how to configure dashboards, as well as additional features such as alerting.

## Next Steps

Now that you have monitoring set up, continue building your gateway infrastructure:
