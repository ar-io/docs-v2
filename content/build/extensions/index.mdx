## What are Extensions?

Extensions are additional scripts and tools you can run alongside your gateway to expand its capabilities or enhance the operator experience.

The full list of community extensions can be found at [gateways.ar.io/#/extensions](https://gateways.ar.io/#/extensions).

## What are Sidecars?

Sidecars are dockerized services that add additional functionality, APIs, and services to AR.IO gateways. They run as separate containers alongside your gateway, providing specialized capabilities.

## Getting Started with Team-Supported Sidecars

The following sidecars are developed and maintained by the AR.IO team, designed to run alongside your gateway as separate containers.
