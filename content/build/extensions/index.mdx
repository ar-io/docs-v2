# What are Extensions?

Extensions are modular tools that can be run alongside an AR.IO gateway to expand its capabilities or enhance the operator experience. These tools provide additional functionality beyond the core gateway services, allowing operators to customize and optimize their infrastructure setup.

Extensions may be produced by AR.IO or third parties, and the official list of supported extensions can be found at [https://gateways.ar.io/#/extensions](https://gateways.ar.io/#/extensions).

Extensions that are designed to extend the capabilities of a gateway by adding additional services are known as **sidecars**. These run as separate containers alongside your gateway and provide specialized functionality:

- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Tools like Grafana for visualizing gateway metrics
- **Data Processing**: Services like ClickHouse with Parquet files for improved query performance
- **Bundling Services**: Bundlers for accepting and processing data items
- **Compute Units**: AO Compute Units for executing AO processes

# Getting Started with Extensions

Each extension will have its own documentation on specific steps and requirements for running. Before installing any extension:

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure your system meets the requirements
2. **Review Documentation**: Read the specific setup guide for each extension
3. **Plan Your Setup**: Consider resource requirements and configuration needs
4. **Test in Development**: Try extensions in a test environment first

# Available Extensions

This is not an exhaustive list of available extensions. For the complete list of supported extensions, see the [official extensions list](https://gateways.ar.io/#/extensions).

# Extension Management

### Installation

Most extensions are deployed using Docker Compose with specific profiles or separate compose files. Follow the individual documentation for each extension to ensure proper setup.

### Configuration

Extensions typically require:

- Environment variable configuration
- Network access to the gateway
- Resource allocation (CPU, memory, storage)
- Optional nginx configuration for external access

## Community Extensions

The AR.IO ecosystem supports third-party extensions. Check the [official extensions list](https://gateways.ar.io/#/extensions) for community-developed tools and integrations.

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues with extensions:

1. **Check Documentation**: Review the specific extension guide
2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure all environment variables are set correctly
3. **Check Logs**: Review container logs for error messages
4. **Community Support**: Join the [AR.IO Discord](https://discord.gg/7zUPfN4D6g) for help
