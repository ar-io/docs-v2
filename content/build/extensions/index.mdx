Transform your AR.IO gateway from a basic data server into a powerful, feature-rich infrastructure platform. Extensions unlock advanced capabilities that dramatically enhance performance, monitoring, and functionality.

## What are Extensions?

Extensions are modular tools that can be run alongside an AR.IO gateway to expand its capabilities or enhance the operator experience. These tools provide additional functionality beyond the core gateway services, allowing operators to customize and optimize their infrastructure setup.

Extensions may be produced by AR.IO or third parties, and the official list of supported extensions can be found at [https://gateways.ar.io/#/extensions](https://gateways.ar.io/#/extensions).

Extensions can take various forms, from simple scripting and bots to comprehensive dockerized services. A specific type of extension known as a **sidecar** consists of dockerized tools designed to run alongside an AR.IO gateway as separate containers, providing specialized functionality:

- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Tools like Grafana for visualizing gateway metrics
- **Data Processing**: Services like ClickHouse with Parquet files for improved query performance
- **Bundling Services**: Bundlers for accepting and processing data items
- **Compute Units**: AO Compute Units for executing AO processes

**Ready to supercharge your gateway?** Explore the AR.IO-developed sidecars below to discover how you can:

- **Monitor performance** with real-time dashboards and analytics
