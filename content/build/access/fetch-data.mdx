The simplest way to access data on Arweave is through **HTTP requests** to gateways. This method works in any web browser and requires no additional setup.

## Fetching Data from Gateways

Gateways are the most performant way to fetch data from Arweave, providing significant advantages over accessing Arweave nodes directly.

**Why Gateways Are Faster:**

- **Content Caching** - Pre-cached data for instant retrieval
- **Data Indexing** - Fast search and query capabilities
- **Network Optimization** - Distributed infrastructure for better performance
- **Content Delivery** - Optimized serving with compression and CDN features

## REST APIs for Fetching Data

Gateways support multiple API endpoints for accessing data:

### Standard Endpoint

Access any transaction using this URL structure:

```
https://<gateway>/<transaction-id>
```

**Examples:**

- `https://arweave.net/bVLEkL1SOPFCzIYi8T_QNnh17VlDp4RylU6YTwCMVRw`
- `https://permagate.io/FguFk5eSth0wO8SKfziYshkSxeIYe7oK9zoPN2PhSc0`

### Raw Data Endpoint

For raw data access that bypasses manifest path resolution:

```
https://<gateway>/raw/<transaction-id>
```

This endpoint returns the raw data bytes without resolving manifest paths, useful when you need the exact stored data.

## Sandboxing

AR.IO gateways implement security measures by redirecting requests to sandbox subdomains for enhanced browser security.

**Why Redirects Happen:**

- **Security Isolation** - Content is served from isolated sandbox environments
- **CSP Protection** - Prevents cross-site scripting attacks
- **Resource Isolation** - Limits potential security vulnerabilities
- **Browser Sandboxing** - Leverages same-origin policy for enhanced security

**What to Expect:**

- Initial request: `https://arweave.net/transaction-id`
- Redirects to: `https://sandbox.arweave.net/transaction-id` (or similar)
- Final content served from sandbox subdomain

**Important:** Always follow redirects in your applications - the final sandbox URL contains the actual content.

  and why it's important for security, see our [Browser
  Sandboxing](/build/advanced/sandboxing) documentation.

## Using in Applications

**JavaScript Example with Fetch:**

```js
// Fetch data from Arweave (follows redirects automatically)
const response = await fetch("https://arweave.net/your-transaction-id", {
  redirect: "follow", // Follow redirects automatically
});

if (!response.ok) {
  throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
}

const data = await response.text();
console.log(data);
```

**HTML Example:**

```html
<!-- Direct image access (browsers handle redirects automatically) -->
<img src="https://arweave.net/your-image-id" alt="My Image" />
```

## Manifests

For organized file collections, use manifests to create friendly path-based URLs:

```
https://arweave.net/<manifest-id>/path/to/file
```

**Example:**

- `https://arweave.net/X8Qm…AOhA/index.html`
- `https://arweave.net/X8Qm…AOhA/styles.css`
- `https://arweave.net/X8Qm…AOhA/assets/logo.png`
