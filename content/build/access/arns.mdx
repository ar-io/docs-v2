[ArNS](https://cookbook.bobinstein.com/fundamentals/accessing-arweave-data/arns.html) provides **human-readable URLs** for your Arweave data, making it easy to share and remember permanent addresses.

## Are You Just Accessing Data?

<Callout type="info">
  **For Data Access:** If you just need to access existing data and don't need
  human-readable URLs, use [HTTP Requests](/how-to-access-data/http-requests)
  for simple access or [GraphQL Queries](/how-to-access-data/graphql-queries)
  for data discovery. ArNS is perfect when you want memorable, permanent URLs
  for your content.
</Callout>

## What is ArNS?

ArNS is a naming system that allows you to register human-readable names that point to your Arweave transactions. Instead of sharing long transaction IDs, you can use memorable URLs.

**Example:**

- **Before:** `https://arweave.net/bVLEkL1SOPFCzIYi8T_QNnh17VlDp4RylU6YTwCMVRw`
- **After:** `https://myapp.arweave.net`

## How ArNS Works

**ANTs (Arweave Name Tokens)** are the key to owning an ArNS name. When you register an ArNS name to an ANT, the ANT becomes the transfer method for that name.

**Key Components:**

- **ArNS Names** - Human-readable identifiers (e.g., `myapp.arweave.net`)
- **ANTs** - Smart contracts that manage name ownership
- **Undernames** - Sub-domains managed by your ANT

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Register an ArNS Name

    - Visit the [ArNS App](https://arns.app)
    - Connect a wallet
    - Choose your desired name
    - Pay the registration fee

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set Your Content

    - Point your ArNS name to a transaction ID
    - Use undernames for additional content
    - Manage your records through the ANT

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using ArNS in Applications

```js
import axios from "axios";

// Fetch content from ArNS
const response = await axios.get("https://myapp.arweave.net/api/data");
console.log(response.data);
```

## Undernames

Create sub-domains under your main ArNS name:

**Examples:**

- `https://api_myapp.arweave.net`
- `https://docs_myapp.arweave.net`
- `https://assets_myapp.arweave.net`

**Benefits:**

- Transferred with the ANT
- Survive name changes

## Why Choose ArNS?

ArNS provides the most user-friendly way to create permanent, memorable URLs for your Arweave data.
