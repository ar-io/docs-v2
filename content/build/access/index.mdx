Once data is stored on Arweave, you need to know how to access it. Choose the method that best fits your needs.

## Getting Started

- [**HTTP Requests**](/build/access/http-requests) - Perfect for simple data retrieval
- [**GraphQL Queries**](/build/access/graphql-queries) - Recommended for developers
- [**ArNS**](/build/access/arns) - For human-readable URLs
- [**Wayfinder**](/build/access/wayfinder) - For advanced applications

## Why Access Methods Matter

Different access methods serve different purposes:

- **HTTP Requests** - Direct, simple access to any transaction
- **GraphQL Queries** - Powerful searching and filtering capabilities
- **ArNS** - Human-readable, permanent addressing
- **Wayfinder** - Decentralized, optimized content discovery
