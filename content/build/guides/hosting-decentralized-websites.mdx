title: "Hosting Decentralized Websites"
description: "Build permanent, censorship-resistant websites on Arweave using manifests and deployment tools"
---

Create **permanent websites** that can't be censored, taken down, or modified after deployment. Host your content on Arweave and serve it through AR.IO gateways for a truly decentralized web experience.

## What Makes It Different?

**Traditional websites:**

- Hosted on centralized servers
- Can be taken down or censored
- Require ongoing hosting costs
- Single point of failure

**Decentralized websites:**

- Stored permanently on Arweave
- Censorship-resistant
- Pay once, host forever
- Distributed across the network

## How It Works

### 1. Arweave Manifests

[Arweave manifests](https://docs.ar.io/concepts/manifests) are JSON files that define how your website's files are organized and linked together. They enable:

- **Friendly URLs** - Access files with readable paths instead of transaction IDs
- **Relative linking** - Use `./style.css` instead of full transaction IDs
- **Fallback pages** - Handle 404 errors gracefully
- **File organization** - Structure your website like a traditional site

**Example manifest:**

```json
{
  "manifest": "arweave/paths",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "index": {
    "path": "index.html"
  },
  "fallback": {
    "id": "404-page-transaction-id"
  },
  "paths": {
    "index.html": {
      "id": "main-page-transaction-id"
    },
    "style.css": {
      "id": "css-transaction-id"
    },
    "script.js": {
      "id": "js-transaction-id"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Deployment Tools

**Permaweb Deploy** - [CLI deployment tool](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-deploy) that:

- Uploads your build folder to Arweave using Turbo
- Creates a manifest automatically
- Updates your ArNS domain
- Integrates with GitHub Actions
- Requires `--deploy-folder` and `--arns-name` parameters

**Arlink** - [User-friendly web interface](https://arlink.ar.io/) for:

- Quick website uploads through the browser
- Manifest generation
- ArNS integration

**ArDrive Web** - [User-friendly interface](https://docs.ar.io/guides/ardrive-web) for:

- File management
- Website building
- Deployment workflows

### 3. ArNS Integration

**Primary Names** - [Decentralized domain names](/learn/arns) that:

- Point to your website's manifest
- Provide human-readable URLs
- Can be updated to point to new versions
- Are owned and controlled by you

## Quick Start

**1. Build your website** - Create a static website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**2. Choose a deployment tool:**

```bash
# Using permaweb-deploy (CLI tool)
npm install permaweb-deploy --save-dev
npx permaweb-deploy --deploy-folder ./build --arns-name your-domain

# Using arlink (web interface)
# Visit the arlink website and upload through the browser
```

**3. Get an ArNS domain** - Register a primary name to point to your website

**4. Access your site** - Visit `https://your-domain.arweave.dev` or any AR.IO gateway

## Benefits

- **Permanent hosting** - Your website will exist forever
- **Censorship resistance** - Cannot be taken down by authorities
- **Cost efficiency** - Pay once, host forever
- **Global distribution** - Served from multiple AR.IO gateways
- **Version control** - Update your ArNS domain to point to new versions
