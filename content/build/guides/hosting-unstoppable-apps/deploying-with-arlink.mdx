</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

- **Deploying with Arlink** - Using the visual web interface for deployments
- **GitHub integration** - Setting up automated deployments from your repository
- **ArNS setup** - Connecting your ArNS name or using free Arlink undernames
- **Build monitoring** - Tracking deployment progress with live logs
- **When to use Arlink** - Understanding limitations and choosing the right tool

## What is Arlink?

Arlink is a web-based deployment platform that simplifies hosting applications on Arweave. It provides a visual interface for developers who prefer graphical tools over command-line interfaces, while maintaining the same permanence and decentralization benefits.

**Key Features:**

- **Visual Interface** - No command-line knowledge required
- **Automated Builds** - Auto-detects build settings and handles the entire build process
- **GitHub Integration** - Deploy directly from your repositories with continuous deployment
- **Real-Time Monitoring** - Live build logs and progress tracking
- **ArNS Management** - Connect existing ArNS names or use free Arlink undernames

<Callout type="info" title="CLI vs Web Interface">
All applications that can be deployed with `permaweb-deploy` CLI can also be deployed with Arlink. Choose the tool that fits your workflow:
- **Arlink**: Visual workflows, quick deployments, smaller projects (under 10MB)
- **permaweb-deploy**: CI/CD pipelines, large applications, custom automation

See [Limitations & Considerations](#limitations--considerations) below to help decide.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before deploying with Arlink, you'll need:

- **Arweave Wallet** - Create one at [Wander](https://www.wander.app/) and add AR tokens or [Turbo credits](https://turbo.ar.io/topup)
- **GitHub Repository** - Your application code in a GitHub repository with build scripts
- **Static Build Output** - Application must build to static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Optional: ArNS Name** - Purchase at [arns.app](https://arns.app) or use free Arlink undernames

<Callout type="info">
Test your build locally (`npm run build`) before deploying to ensure it produces static output.
</Callout>

## Deployment Methods

Arlink offers two main deployment approaches:

- **GitHub Deploy** - Connect your repository for automated builds with continuous deployment
- **Template Hub** - Start with pre-built templates or add your own at [arlink.ar.io/templates](https://arlink.ar.io/templates)

This guide focuses on GitHub deployment, which is the most common approach for custom applications.

## Deploying from GitHub

The deployment process consists of four main phases. For detailed step-by-step instructions, see the [Arlink Quickstart Guide](https://arlink.gitbook.io/arlink-docs/getting-started/quickstart).

### 1. Connect & Authorize

Navigate to the [Arlink Dashboard](https://arlink.arweave.net/) and connect your Arweave wallet (Wander). Then authorize GitHub access to enable repository connections.

{/* Screenshot: Arlink dashboard with "Connect Wallet" button highlighted */}

{/* Screenshot: GitHub authorization page showing permissions requested by Arlink */}

<Callout type="info">
Arlink only requests read access to your repositories and webhook permissions for continuous deployment.
</Callout>

### 2. Configure Deployment

Select your GitHub repository and branch. Arlink will automatically detect:

- **Package Manager** - npm, yarn, or pnpm
- **Framework** - React, Next.js, Vue, Astro, etc.
- **Build Command** - Usually `npm run build`
- **Output Directory** - `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, etc.

{/* Screenshot: Repository selection interface with detected build settings */}

Review the auto-detected settings and adjust if needed. Ensure your output directory matches your framework:

| Framework | Output Directory | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Vite/React | `dist/` | Default configuration |
| Next.js | `out/` | Requires `output: 'export'` in config |
| Astro | `dist/` | Static by default |
| Create React App | `build/` | Default configuration |

### 3. Choose Domain

Select how your application will be accessible:

**Free Arlink Undername:**
- Format: `yourname_arlink.arweave.net`
- No ArNS name purchase required
- Available immediately

**Existing ArNS Name:**
- Use your purchased ArNS name (e.g., `myapp.arweave.net`)
- Optionally add undernames (e.g., `staging_myapp.arweave.net`)
- Arlink automatically updates ArNS records

{/* Screenshot: Domain selection interface showing Arlink undername and existing ArNS options */}

### 4. Deploy & Monitor

Click **Deploy** to start the build process. Arlink will clone your repository, install dependencies, build your application, and upload to Arweave.

{/* Screenshot: Build progress view with live logs and status indicators */}

**Build Timeline:**
- Small apps (~1MB): 2-3 minutes
- Medium apps (1-5MB): 3-5 minutes
- Large apps (5-10MB): 5-10 minutes

<Callout type="warn" title="Build Limits">
Arlink enforces a **10MB max build output** and **10-minute build timeout**. For larger applications, use `permaweb-deploy` CLI instead.
</Callout>

Once complete, your application is permanently deployed and accessible via:
- Your chosen domain (e.g., `myapp_arlink.arweave.net`)
- Any AR.IO gateway (e.g., `myapp_arlink.g8way.io`)
- Direct transaction ID

{/* Screenshot: Successful deployment screen showing URL, transaction ID, and deployment stats */}

## ArNS Integration

Arlink offers two domain options for your deployments:

### Free Arlink Undernames

Arlink provides free subdomains under the `arlink` ArNS name:

- **Format**: `yourname_arlink.arweave.net`
- **Cost**: Free (no ArNS purchase required)
- **Availability**: Instant, accessible via all AR.IO gateways
- **Limitation**: Must be unique across all Arlink deployments

### Existing ArNS Names

Connect your owned ArNS names for custom domains:

- Select your ArNS name from the dashboard dropdown
- Optionally add undernames for versioning (e.g., `staging_myapp`, `v1_myapp`)
- Arlink automatically updates ArNS records on deployment

{/* Screenshot: ArNS name selector showing owned names and undername input field */}

<Callout type="info">
Undernames use underscore separators: `staging_myapp` not `staging.myapp`. See [Using Undernames for Versioning](/build/guides/hosting-unstoppable-apps/using-undernames-for-versioning) for versioning strategies.
</Callout>

**Deployment Management:**

The Arlink dashboard lets you view deployment history, manage undernames, and rollback to previous deployments by updating which transaction ID your ArNS name points to.

{/* Screenshot: Arlink dashboard showing deployment history and rollback options */}

## Limitations & Considerations

Understanding Arlink's limitations helps you choose the right deployment tool for your project.

### Size and Time Constraints

| Constraint | Limit | Impact |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Max Build Output | 10 MB | Applications larger than 10MB cannot be deployed |
| Build Timeout | 10 minutes | Complex builds exceeding 10 minutes will fail |
| Deployment Cost | Subsidized (beta) | Pricing may change after beta period |

<Callout type="warn" title="Build Size Limit">
The 10MB limit applies to your **build output**, not your source code. Check your build size with:

```bash
npm run build
du -sh dist/  # or build/, out/, etc.
```

If your build exceeds 10MB, use `permaweb-deploy` CLI instead.
</Callout>

        <ul>
          <li>Your build output exceeds 10MB</li>
          <li>You need custom deployment scripts</li>
          <li>You want CI/CD pipeline integration</li>
          <li>You need Ethereum wallet deployment</li>
          <li>You require Base-ETH payment options</li>
          <li>You want full control over deployment process</li>
        </ul>
      </>
    }
  />
</Cards>

### Additional Limitations

**Build Environment:**
- Standard Node.js environment only
- No custom build tools or dependencies
- Limited environment variable support
- No Docker or custom runtimes

**Deployment Features:**
- No support for Ethereum wallet signatures
- No custom payment methods (Base-ETH, etc.)
- Limited automation beyond GitHub integration
- No programmatic API access

**ArNS Management:**
- Cannot create new ArNS names through Arlink
- Must purchase ArNS names separately at [arns.app](https://arns.app)
- Limited undername configuration options

<Callout type="info" title="When to Switch to CLI">
If you outgrow Arlink's capabilities, all your existing deployments can be managed with `permaweb-deploy` CLI. See the [other guides in this series](/build/guides/hosting-unstoppable-apps) for CLI deployment instructions.
</Callout>

## Continuous Deployment

Arlink automatically sets up continuous deployment when you authorize GitHub access.

### How It Works

Arlink adds webhooks to your repository to detect push events. When you push to your configured branch, Arlink automatically triggers a new build and deployment.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update homepage content"
git push origin main  # Triggers automatic deployment
```

{/* Screenshot: Webhook configuration settings in Arlink dashboard */}

### Branch-Based Deployments

Configure multiple branches to deploy to different undernames:

| Branch | Undername | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `main` | `myapp` (root) | Production |
| `develop` | `staging_myapp` | Staging |
| `feature/*` | `dev_myapp` | Development |

Monitor all deployments in the Arlink dashboard, which shows build status, commit hashes, build logs, and transaction IDs.

For more details on continuous deployment setup, see the [Arlink Documentation](https://arlink.gitbook.io/arlink-docs).
