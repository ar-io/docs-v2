Create **permanent dApps** using the ArDrive web interface. This guide shows you how to deploy your dApp or website to the permaweb using ArDrive's user-friendly interface.

## What You'll Learn

- How to deploy dApps using ArDrive web
- Creating manifests for proper file routing
- Assigning friendly ArNS names
- Updating your dApp with new versions

## Prerequisites

**For simple apps and websites:**

- Your dApp files ready for deployment
- ArDrive account (free to create)

**For advanced applications:**

- dApp prepared with hash routing and relative file paths
- Static files built (for frameworks like React)
- Learn more about [preparing your dApp for deployment](https://docs.ardrive.io/docs/misc/deploy/)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Log into ArDrive

    Go to the [ArDrive web app](https://app.ardrive.io/#/sign-in) and log in using your preferred method. If you don't have an account, follow the instructions to create one.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Select or Create a Drive

    Navigate to the drive where you want your project hosted. If you need a new drive:

    - Click the big red "New" button at the top left
    - Create a new drive
    - **Important:** Set the drive to **public** for others to access your dApp

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Upload Your Project

    With your drive selected:

    - Click the big red "New" button again
    - Select "Upload Folder"
    - Navigate to your project's root directory (or built directory if required)
    - Select the entire directory to maintain your project's file structure

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Confirm Upload

    Review the upload and associated cost. If everything looks correct, click "Confirm".

    <Callout type="info">
      **Cost Note:** Uploading to Arweave isn't free, but costs are usually quite small compared to the benefits of permanent hosting.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Create the Manifest

    While ArDrive displays files as a traditional file structure, they don't actually exist that way on Arweave. The manifest acts as a map to all your dApp files:

    - Navigate into your newly created folder by double-clicking it
    - Click the big red "New" button again
    - Select "New Manifest" in the "Advanced" section
    - Name the manifest and save it inside the folder you just created

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Get the Data TX ID

    Once the manifest is created:

    - Click on it to expand its details
    - Go to the "Details" tab
    - Find the "Data TX ID" on the bottom right
    - Copy this unique identifier for your dApp

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### View and Share Your dApp

    Your dApp is now live on the permaweb forever!

    - Append the Data TX ID to an Arweave gateway URL: `https://arweave.net/YOUR-TX-ID`
    - It may take a few minutes for files to propagate through the network
    - Once propagated, your dApp is accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Assign a Friendly Name (Optional)

    Make your dApp easier to access with an ArNS name:

    - If you own an ArNS name, you'll be prompted during manifest creation
    - If not, purchase one from [arns.app](https://arns.arweave.net)
    - You can also assign an ArNS name later by clicking the three dots next to any file and selecting "Assign ArNS name"

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Updating Your dApp

Files uploaded to Arweave are **permanent and immutable** - they cannot be changed. However, the [Arweave File System (ArFS)](/build/advanced/arfs) protocol lets you "replace" them with new versions while keeping old ones accessible.

### How Updates Work

**To update your dApp:**

1. **Make your changes** and build the static directory
2. **Upload the entire folder again** to the same location
3. **Follow the same steps** as the original upload
4. **Create a new manifest** with the same name as the old one
5. **The new manifest generates a new TX ID** for the updated dApp

**Important Notes:**

- The old version remains accessible to anyone with the correct TX ID
- Old files won't display in ArDrive unless you view file history
- Each version gets its own unique transaction ID

## Benefits of ArDrive Web Deployment

- **User-friendly interface** - No command line required
- **Automatic manifest creation** - Handles file routing for you
- **Integrated ArNS support** - Easy domain name assignment
- **Version management** - Built-in file history and updates
- **Cost transparency** - See upload costs before confirming
