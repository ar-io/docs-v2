description: "Create web3 identity using ArNS names that resolve to wallet addresses"
---

Create **web3 identity** using ArNS names. Primary names allow you to use human-readable names as your identity in the Arweave ecosystem, making it easy for others to find and interact with you.

## What Are Primary Names?

**Primary names** are ArNS names used as identity that:

- **Resolve to wallet addresses** - Link human-readable names to wallet addresses
- **Provide web3 identity** - Give users friendly names for their Arweave identity
- **Are bidirectional** - Can resolve from name to address or address to name
- **Require ownership** - Only the owner of an ArNS name can set it as their primary name
- **Enable secure verification** - Ownership requirement ensures identity authenticity
- **Work across gateways** - Accessible from any AR.IO gateway

## How It Works

### 1. Identity Registration

**Register a primary name:**

- Choose a unique name (e.g., `jonniesparkles`)
- Pay the registration fee
- Link the name to your wallet address
- Use as your web3 identity

### 2. Bidirectional Resolution

**Name to address resolution:**

- `jonniesparkles` → `OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU`
- Others can find your wallet using your name
- Use in dApps and applications

**Address to name resolution:**

- `OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU` → `jonniesparkles`
- Find the name associated with any wallet
- Verify identity in transactions

### 3. Application Integration

**Use in supported apps:**

- **Send tokens to "jonniesparkles"** instead of copying long wallet addresses
- **Display friendly names** as usernames when connecting wallets
- **Apps resolve names** to wallet addresses using the AR.IO SDK
- **Seamless user experience** with human-readable identifiers

## Basic Integration

### Using the AR.IO SDK

**Get a primary name by address:**

```javascript
import { ARIO } from "@ar-io/sdk";

const ario = new ARIO();

// Get the primary name for a wallet address
const nameData = await ario.getPrimaryName({
  address: "OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU",
});
console.log(nameData.name); // e.g., "jonniesparkles"
```

**Get primary name data:**

```javascript
import { ARIO } from "@ar-io/sdk";

const ario = new ARIO();

// Get primary name data for a name
const nameData = await ario.getPrimaryName({
  name: "jonniesparkles",
});
console.log(nameData.owner); // e.g., "OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU"
console.log(nameData.name); // e.g., "jonniesparkles"
```

## How Apps Use Primary Names

**Token transfers:**

- Send tokens to "jonniesparkles" instead of copying `OU48aJtcq3KjsEqSUWDVpynh1xP2Y1VI-bwiSukAktU`
- Apps automatically resolve the name to the wallet address
- Much more user-friendly than long wallet addresses

**User interfaces:**

- Display "jonniesparkles" as username when wallet is connected
- Show friendly names in transaction histories
- Make interactions more personal and memorable

**Developer integration:**

- Use the [AR.IO SDK](https://docs.ar.io/ar-io-sdk/ario/primary-names/get-primary-name) to resolve names
- Support primary names in your dApp
- Enhance user experience with human-readable identifiers
- **Trust identity ownership** - Only name owners can set primary names, ensuring secure verification

## Benefits

- **Web3 identity** - Use human-readable names as your identity
- **Easy discovery** - Others can find you by name instead of wallet address
- **Bidirectional resolution** - Resolve name to address or address to name
- **Secure verification** - Only name owners can set primary names, preventing impersonation
- **Permanent ownership** - Own your identity forever
- **App integration** - Works in any app that supports primary names
