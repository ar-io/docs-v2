## AO Computer

AO (Actor Oriented) is a hyper-parallel computing platform built on Arweave that enables decentralized applications to run with unlimited computational capacity. AO provides the compute layer for the AR.IO Network's smart contracts and token operations.

## Public Key

A cryptographic key that can be shared publicly and is used to verify digital signatures or encrypt data. In the AR.IO context, public keys are used to identify wallet addresses and verify transactions.

## Native Address

An address format that uses the raw public key bytes directly, without additional encoding or transformation. This is the most basic form of an Arweave address.

## Normalized Address

A standardized address format that ensures consistent representation across different systems and contexts. Normalized addresses help prevent issues with address matching and lookup operations.

## Optimistic Indexing

A data indexing strategy where new data is immediately made available for queries while verification processes continue in the background. This approach improves performance while maintaining data integrity through eventual consistency.
