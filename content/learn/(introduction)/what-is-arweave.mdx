Arweave is a decentralized storage network that ensures data is **permanent**, **affordable**, and **scalable**. Think of it as a global, tamper-proof hard drive where your files—photos, documents, or apps—stay accessible forever. It's the foundation for the [AR.IO Network](https://ar.io), powering a "permaweb" where data never disappears.

Below, we break down Arweave's core features in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

## A Datachain for Permanent Storage

Arweave is like Bitcoin, but for data. It solves one problem really well: **storing data permanently**. Once uploaded, your data—whether a tweet, NFT, or website—is immutable and preserved indefinitely.

### How Does It Work?

- **Blockweave Architecture**: Unlike a blockchain's single chain, Arweave's blockweave links each new data block to the previous one and a random older block. Data is split into 256 KiB chunks in a secure Merkle tree, ensuring miners keep all data to add new blocks.

- **Succinct Proofs of Random Access (SPoRA)**: Miners prove they store multiple data copies by accessing random chunks, verified efficiently with Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs). This combines proof-of-work and proof-of-storage, making data loss nearly impossible.

**In Simple Terms**: Picture a library where new books reference older ones, and librarians must keep every book to add more. SPoRA ensures they prove they’ve got the books, keeping your data safe forever.

## Pay Once, Store Forever: No Recurring Fees

Pay a one-time fee to upload data, and it's stored "forever"—no subscriptions or renewals.

### How Does It Work?

- **Endowment Fund**: Your fee, based on 200 years of storage for 20 replicas, goes mostly into a fund that slowly pays miners in AR tokens to maintain data. It assumes storage costs drop over time, making the fund sustainable.

**In Simple Terms**: It's a “forever stamp” for data. Your payment funds a pot that keeps paying storage keepers, lasting longer as tech gets cheaper.

## Practically Unlimited Storage

Arweave can practically store unlimited data, from small files to entire digital archives, without hitting a ceiling. The theoretical limit is 2^256 bytes which for scale is more atoms than there are in the universe.

### How Does It Work?

- **Layer 1 Transactions**: Data is stored as 256 KiB chunks on the blockweave, replicated across many nodes. As more nodes join with standard hardware, storage capacity grows limitlessly.

- **Bundling with [AR.IO Network](https://ar.io) and Turbo**: Bundling packs multiple files into one transaction, reducing costs and congestion. AR.IO Network and Turbo (a Layer 2 tool) optimize this, enabling fast, cheap uploads of large datasets like websites.

## What Arweave doesn't solve well? Access

Arweave solve's one problem and solve's it well. Storing your data for a very long-time.

It doesn't, however, incentivise the indexing and access for data.
