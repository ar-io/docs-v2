# Performance Evaluation

## Gateway Classifications

Consider the following classifications:

- **Functional or Passed Gateways**: are gateways that meet or surpass the network's performance and quality standards.
- **Deficient or Failed Gateways**: are gateways that fall short of the network's performance expectations.
- **Functional or Submitted Observers**: are selected observers who diligently perform their duties and submit observation reports and contract interactions.
- **Deficient or Failed Observers**: are selected observers who do not fulfill their duty of submitting observation reports and contract interactions.

## Evaluation Process

At the end of an epoch, the smart contract will assess the results from the observers and determine a pass / fail score for each gateway:

- If greater than or equal to 50% of submitted observer contract interactions indicate a PASS score, then that gateway is considered Functional and eligible for gateway rewards.
- Else, if greater than 50% of submitted observer contract interactions indicate a FAIL score, then that gateway is considered Deficient and ineligible for gateway rewards.

These results will determine how reward distributions are made for that epoch.

## Evaluation Timeline

Rewards shall be distributed after **forty (40) minutes** (approx. **twenty (20) Arweave blocks**) in the following epoch have elapsed. This delay ensures that all observation contract interactions are safely confirmed by the Arweave network without risk of "forking out" prior to the evaluation and reward distribution process.

## Key Features

- **Majority Rule**: Gateway performance is determined by majority vote from observers
- **Binary Scoring**: Simple pass/fail system for clear performance assessment
- **Network Confirmation**: Delay ensures all votes are confirmed before evaluation
- **Transparent Process**: All evaluations are based on onchain data

## Consequences of Performance

### Functional Gateways

- Eligible for gateway rewards
- Maintain good standing in the network
- Continue to be considered for observer selection

### Deficient Gateways

- Ineligible for gateway rewards
- Risk being marked as deficient for multiple epochs
- May face additional penalties for prolonged poor performance

### Observer Performance

- Functional observers receive observer rewards
- Deficient observers forfeit observer rewards
- Deficient observers who are also functional gateways have their gateway reward reduced by 25%
