## Overview

The Observation and Incentive Protocol ensures network quality through peer monitoring and performance-based rewards. Gateways are incentivized to maintain high performance while also serving as "observers" that evaluate their peers' ArNS resolution capabilities.

The protocol operates on **24-hour epochs** where up to 50 gateways are selected as observers to test other gateways against ArNS name resolution criteria. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem with transparent, consensus-based performance evaluation.

## Architecture Overview

The Observer Protocol operates through a systematic process where selected gateways monitor their peers and report findings to maintain network quality:

        OBS->>GW: Test ArNS resolution (10 names)

        OBS->>OBS: Score: Pass/Fail
    end
    
    Note over SC,AR: Reporting Phase
    OBS->>AR: Upload detailed JSON report
    AR-->>OBS: Confirm storage
    OBS->>SC: Submit failed gateways list
    SC-->>OBS: Confirm interaction
    
    Note over SC,AR: Evaluation & Rewards
    SC->>SC: Tally all observer votes
    SC->>SC: Determine gateway status<br/>(≥50% pass = functional)
    SC->>SC: Calculate reward distribution
    SC->>OBS: Distribute observer rewards
    SC->>GW: Distribute gateway rewards<br/>(if functional)
```

## Epoch Cycle and Responsibilities

Each 24-hour epoch follows a structured process with specific responsibilities for gateways and observers:

### Epoch Start
- **Smart Contract**: Selects up to 50 observers using weighted random selection
- **Smart Contract**: Generates 2 prescribed ArNS names for all observers to test
- **Selected Observers**: Receive notification of selection and prescribed names

### Observation Phase
- **Observers**: Choose 8 additional ArNS names to test (total of 10 names per gateway)
- **Observers**: Test assigned gateways for ArNS resolution, wallet ownership, content hashes, and response times
- **Target Gateways**: Respond to resolution requests and serve content

### Reporting Phase
- **Observers**: Upload detailed JSON reports to Arweave for transparency
- **Observers**: Submit failed gateway lists to the AR.IO Smart Contract for consensus voting

### Evaluation and Distribution
- **Smart Contract**: Tallies all observer votes (≥50% pass = functional gateway)
- **Smart Contract**: Distributes rewards at epoch end based on performance
- **Functional Gateways/Observers**: Receive ARIO token rewards automatically

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Monitoring**: Peer-to-peer evaluation ensures no single point of failure
- **Consensus-Based Scoring**: Majority rule (≥50% pass votes) determines gateway functionality  
- **Performance Incentives**: Only functional gateways and observers receive ARIO token rewards
- **Transparent Accountability**: All reports permanently stored on Arweave and viewable at [gateways.ar.io](https://gateways.ar.io)
- **Sustainable Funding**: Protocol balance funded by ArNS name purchases, aligning rewards with network usage
