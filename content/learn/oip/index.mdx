# Observation and Incentive Protocol (OIP)

## What is OIP?

The Observation and Incentive Protocol is designed to maintain and enhance the operational integrity of gateways on the AR.IO Network. It achieves this through a combination of incentivizing gateways for good performance and tasking those gateways to fulfill the role of "observers".

The protocol is intentionally simple and adaptable, employing a smart contract-based method for onchain "voting" to assess peer performance while being flexible on how that performance is measured. This setup permits gateway and observer nodes to experiment and evolve best practices for performance evaluation, all while operating within the bounds of the network's immutable [smart contract](/ario-contract), thus eliminating the need for frequent contract updates (forks).

## How OIP Works

In this protocol, observers evaluate their gateway peers' performance to resolve ArNS names. Their aim is to ensure each gateway in the network accurately resolves a subset of names and assigning a pass / fail score based on their findings.

A key component of the protocol is its reward mechanism. This system is predicated on gateway performance and compliance with observation duties. Gateways that excel are tagged as "Functional Gateways" and earn rewards, while those that do not meet the criteria, "Deficient Gateways" risk facing penalties â€“ namely, the lack of rewards.

## Funding and Rewards

Funds for incentive rewards are derived from the protocol balance, which consists of ARIO tokens initially allocated at network genesis as well as those collected from ArNS asset purchases. Every epoch, this balance is utilized to distribute rewards to qualifying gateways and observers based on certain performance metrics.

## Key Benefits

- **Network Integrity**: Ensures gateways maintain high performance standards
- **Decentralized Monitoring**: Uses peer-to-peer observation rather than centralized oversight
- **Economic Incentives**: Rewards good performance and penalizes poor performance
- **Adaptive System**: Allows for experimentation and evolution of best practices
- **Immutable Framework**: Operates within smart contract bounds without frequent updates
