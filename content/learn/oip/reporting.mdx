# Reporting

## Observer Responsibilities

Selected observers have specific duties each epoch: test gateways, document results, and submit findings through two channels. Proper completion of these responsibilities determines observer rewards and future selection chances.

## Dual Submission Process

Observers must submit their findings through both channels to fulfill their duties:

### 1. Detailed Reports to Arweave
- **Format**: Comprehensive JSON reports with full evaluation data
- **Purpose**: Permanent audit trail and transparency
- **Content**: Complete test results, timing data, and failure details

### 2. Contract Interactions to AR.IO Smart Contract
- **Format**: List of failed gateways
- **Purpose**: Efficient vote tallying for consensus
- **Content**: Binary pass/fail determinations for each gateway tested

## Observer Evaluations

Observers test assigned gateways against 10 ArNS names (2 prescribed + 8 chosen) and document their findings:

### Evaluation Results

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "2rem", margin: "2rem 0"}}>
  <div style={{flex: 1}}>
    <img src="/observer-report-pass.png" alt="Successful gateway evaluation report" style={{width: "100%"}} />
    <p style={{textAlign: "center", marginTop: "1rem", fontStyle: "italic"}}>
      <strong>Passing Report:</strong> Gateway successfully resolves ArNS names with correct status codes (200), transaction IDs, and data hashes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style={{flex: 1}}>
    <img src="/observer-report-fail.png" alt="Failed gateway evaluation report" style={{width: "100%"}} />
    <p style={{textAlign: "center", marginTop: "1rem", fontStyle: "italic"}}>
      <strong>Failing Report:</strong> Gateway fails ArNS resolution tests due to ownership issues, timeouts (5000ms), or missing content.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

Observers evaluate gateways based on:
- **Gateway Wallet Ownership**: Verifies correct wallet address
- **ArNS Resolution**: Tests successful name-to-transaction resolution
- **Content Hash Verification**: Ensures data integrity
- **Response Times**: Measures performance within limits

## Observer Rewards and Penalties

Observer performance directly impacts rewards and future participation:

### Successful Observer Performance
- **Observer Reward**: Observers who submit both reports and contract interactions receive the Observer Reward
- **Future Selection**: Successful reporting improves Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)
- **Increased Chances**: Higher OPRW increases likelihood of future observer selection and more reward opportunities

### Failed Observer Performance
- **No Observer Reward**: Observers who fail to submit required reports forfeit their Observer Reward
- **Gateway Penalty**: If the deficient observer is also a functional gateway, their gateway reward is **reduced by 25%**
- **Reduced Selection**: Failed submissions decrease OPRW, diminishing future observer selection chances
- **Lost Opportunities**: Lower selection probability means fewer chances to earn Observer Rewards

## Observer Accountability

The system tracks observer performance to ensure network quality:

- **Submission Tracking**: Both Arweave reports and contract interactions must be submitted
- **Performance History**: Observer submission record affects future selection probability
- **Reward Impact**: Consistent reporting builds credibility and increases earning potential

## Recap

Observer reporting responsibilities are straightforward but critical for network operation:

- **Dual Submission Required**: Both detailed reports (Arweave) and contract interactions (Smart Contract)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Evaluate gateways on ownership, resolution, content integrity, and performance
- **Clear Incentives**: Successful observers earn rewards; deficient ones face penalties and reduced future selection
- **Long-term Impact**: Observer performance compounds through OPRW, affecting future earning potential

Observers play a vital role in maintaining network quality, with clear rewards for diligent service and meaningful penalties for negligence.
