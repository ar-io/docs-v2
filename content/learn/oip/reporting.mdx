## Observer Responsibilities

Selected observers have specific duties each epoch: test gateways, document results, and submit findings through two channels. Proper completion of these responsibilities determines observer rewards and future selection chances.

## Dual Submission Process

Observers must submit their findings through both channels to fulfill their duties:

### 1. Detailed Reports to Arweave

- **Format**: Comprehensive JSON reports with full evaluation data
- **Purpose**: Permanent audit trail and transparency
- **Content**: Complete test results, timing data, and failure details

### 2. Contract Interactions to AR.IO Smart Contract

- **Format**: List of failed gateways
- **Purpose**: Efficient vote tallying for consensus
- **Content**: Binary pass/fail determinations for each gateway tested

## Observer Evaluations

Observers test assigned gateways against 10 ArNS names (2 prescribed + 8 chosen) and document their findings:

### Evaluation Results

<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "2rem", margin: "2rem 0" }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <img
      src="/observer-report-pass.png"
      alt="Successful gateway evaluation report"
      style={{ width: "100%" }}
    />
    <p style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "1rem", fontStyle: "italic" }}>
      <strong>Passing Report:</strong> Gateway successfully resolves ArNS names
      with correct status codes (200), transaction IDs, and data hashes.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <img
      src="/observer-report-fail.png"
      alt="Failed gateway evaluation report"
      style={{ width: "100%" }}
    />
    <p style={{ textAlign: "center", marginTop: "1rem", fontStyle: "italic" }}>
      <strong>Failing Report:</strong> Gateway fails ArNS resolution tests due
      to ownership issues, timeouts (5000ms), or missing content.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

Observers evaluate gateways based on:

- **Gateway Wallet Ownership**: Verifies correct wallet address
- **ArNS Resolution**: Tests successful name-to-transaction resolution
- **Content Hash Verification**: Ensures data integrity
- **Response Times**: Measures performance within limits
- **Chunk/Offset Validation**: Cryptographic verification of data chunks (for selected gateways)

## Chunk/Offset Assessment Reporting

For gateways selected for chunk/offset validation, observers perform additional testing and reporting:

### Validation Process

- **Offset Selection**: Random offsets within the stable weave range are chosen for testing
- **Chunk Retrieval**: Observers request chunk data using `GET /chunk/{offset}` endpoint
- **Merkle Proof Verification**: Cryptographic validation ensures chunk authenticity
- **Binary Search**: Efficient transaction lookup using cached metadata for proof validation

### Reporting Details

- **Individual Assessments**: Each offset test is tracked with pass/fail/skipped status
- **Enforcement Status**: Reports include whether chunk/offset failures affect gateway status
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and validation results are documented
- **Early Stopping**: Tests stop immediately upon first successful validation

### Report Structure

```json
{
  "offsetAssessments": {
    "plannedOffsets": [12345, 67890, ...],
    "actualAssessments": [...],
    "validatedOffset": 12345,
    "pass": true,
    "enforcementEnabled": true
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **Initial Implementation**: During the initial rollout phase, only a very
  small portion of gateways will be checked for chunk/offset validation, and the
  current validation criteria are extremely lenient to ensure smooth network
  operation.
</Callout>

## Observer Rewards and Penalties

Observer performance directly impacts rewards and future participation:

### Successful Observer Performance

- **Observer Reward**: Observers who submit both reports and contract interactions receive the Observer Reward
- **Future Selection**: Successful reporting improves Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)
- **Increased Chances**: Higher OPRW increases likelihood of future observer selection and more reward opportunities

### Failed Observer Performance

- **No Observer Reward**: Observers who fail to submit required reports forfeit their Observer Reward
- **Gateway Penalty**: If the deficient observer is also a functional gateway, their gateway reward is **reduced by 25%**
- **Reduced Selection**: Failed submissions decrease OPRW, diminishing future observer selection chances
- **Lost Opportunities**: Lower selection probability means fewer chances to earn Observer Rewards

## Observer Accountability

The system tracks observer performance to ensure network quality:

- **Submission Tracking**: Both Arweave reports and contract interactions must be submitted
- **Performance History**: Observer submission record affects future selection probability
- **Reward Impact**: Consistent reporting builds credibility and increases earning potential
