# Observation Process

## Daily Epochs

The Observation protocol is organized around **daily epochs**, periods of time that are broken into an observation reporting and tallying phase. The protocol is followed across each epoch, promoting consistent healthy network activity that can form pro-social behaviors and react to malicious circumstances.

## Onchain Reports

The to-be-evaluated ArNS names include a set of **two (2)** names randomly determined by the protocol, known as "prescribed names", which are common across all observers within the epoch, as well as a set of **eight (8)** "chosen names" picked at the discretion of each individual observer.

"Prescribed names" are assigned to act as a common denominator / baseline while "chosen names" allow each observer to evaluate names that may be important to their operation.

## Report Submission

Observers shall upload their completed reports (in JSON format) to the Arweave network as an onchain audit trail. In addition, observers shall submit an interaction to the AR.IO smart contract detailing each gateway that they observed to have "failed" their assessments.

These "votes" are tallied and used to determine the reward distribution.

## Epoch Structure

Each epoch follows a consistent structure:

1. **Observer Selection**: Gateways are randomly selected as observers based on weighted criteria
2. **Name Assignment**: Prescribed names are randomly determined, observers choose additional names
3. **Observation Period**: Observers evaluate gateway performance on assigned names
4. **Report Submission**: Observers submit their findings to the Arweave network and smart contract
5. **Evaluation Phase**: Smart contract tallies votes and determines pass/fail scores
6. **Reward Distribution**: Rewards are distributed based on performance results

## Key Features

- **Transparent Process**: All reports are stored onchain for auditability
- **Flexible Evaluation**: Mix of prescribed and chosen names allows for comprehensive assessment
- **Decentralized Monitoring**: Peer-to-peer evaluation rather than centralized oversight
- **Consistent Timing**: Daily epochs ensure regular network health checks
