## Overview

ARIO is the multifunction [AO Computer](/glossary) based token that powers the AR.IO Network and its suite of permanent cloud applications. Built on AO, ARIO leverages the computational power and permanence of the Arweave ecosystem to create a robust, decentralized infrastructure token.

### Key Features

- **Native AO Token**: ARIO is built directly on AO Computer, utilizing its decentralized compute capabilities for smart contract execution and network operations
- **Staking-Based Infrastructure**: The network operates on a staking-based incentive system where gateway operators secure infrastructure services through token commitment
- **Multi-utility Design**: ARIO serves multiple functions within the ecosystem, from network participation to governance and payments

## Incentive Mechanisms

ARIO's design creates powerful incentives for network participants through multiple reward streams:

### Gateway Operator Incentives

- **Staking Rewards**: Gateway operators earn rewards for maintaining network infrastructure and providing reliable data services
- **Performance Bonuses**: Additional rewards for gateways that demonstrate high uptime and fast response times
- **Network Growth Rewards**: Operators benefit as the network scales and generates more activity

### Delegator Rewards

- **Delegated Staking**: Token holders can delegate their ARIO to trusted gateway operators to participate in network operations
- **Increased Operator Stake**: Delegation enhances gateway operator visibility and influence within the network
- **Shared Risk and Rewards**: Delegators participate in the risk and rewards of gateway operations
- **Withdrawal Flexibility**: Delegated tokens can be withdrawn following the same vault lock period rules

### Ecosystem Participation

- **ArNS Revenue Sharing**: Name registration fees flow back to network participants through the reward distribution mechanism
- **Protocol Growth**: As network usage increases, token utility and value proposition strengthen
- **Community Incentives**: Active participation in governance and ecosystem development is rewarded

## Staking Architecture

The AR.IO Network implements a robust staking-based incentive system that ensures infrastructure reliability and network participation:

### Gateway Operator Requirements

- Gateway operators must stake a minimum amount of ARIO tokens to join the network
- Staking demonstrates commitment to network objectives and promotes infrastructure reliability
- Only gateways that pass [Observation and Incentive Protocol](/learn/oip) evaluations receive rewards
- Staked tokens remain locked until withdrawal is initiated or vault period expires

### Network Quality Assurance

- **Non-Inflationary Design**: Fixed supply of 1 billion ARIO tokens with no minting mechanism
- **Immutable Protocol**: No governance control or special write access for upgrades
- **Infrastructure Focus**: Staking secures gateway infrastructure for permanent cloud services
- **Peer Monitoring**: Gateways serve as observers, testing and evaluating each other's performance

### Economic Incentives

- Gateway operators earn rewards only when they pass observation evaluations (â‰¥50% consensus)
- Staking creates opportunity cost that aligns operator incentives with network health
- Observer gateways receive additional rewards for monitoring network quality
- Delegated staking allows broader community participation in successful gateway operations

## Built on AO Computer

ARIO's foundation on AO Computer provides unique advantages:

### Computational Permanence

- All token operations and smart contracts benefit from Arweave's permanent storage
- Network history and token transactions are immutably recorded
- Computational results are verifiable and permanent

### Decentralized Execution

- Token logic runs across distributed AO processes, eliminating single points of failure
- Smart contract upgrades follow community governance processes
- Network operations scale with AO's computational capacity

### Ecosystem Integration

- Native compatibility with other AO-based applications and tokens
- Seamless interaction with Arweave's data storage layer
- Built-in interoperability with the broader permaweb ecosystem
