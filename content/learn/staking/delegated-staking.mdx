## What is Delegated Staking?

Delegated staking allows you to participate in the AR.IO Network's reward system without running your own gateway. By staking your ARIO tokens on existing gateways, you can earn rewards while supporting network infrastructure.

When you delegate stake to a gateway, you're essentially lending your tokens to increase that gateway's total stake. This increases the gateway's chances of being selected as an observer, which means more potential rewards for both the gateway operator and you as a delegator.

## How It Works

### 1. **Choose a Gateway**

Select a high-performing gateway that aligns with your goals. Look for gateways with:

- Strong uptime and performance
- Competitive reward sharing percentages
- Reliable operation history

### 2. **Delegate Your Tokens**

Use the [Gateway Portal](https://gateways.arweave.net/#/staking) to delegate your ARIO tokens to your chosen gateway. The process is simple and secure.

### 3. **Earn Rewards**

Receive your share of the gateway's rewards based on the percentage set by the gateway operator. Rewards are distributed automatically based on the gateway's performance.

## Benefits of Delegated Staking

- **Passive Income**: Earn rewards without running infrastructure
- **Network Participation**: Support the AR.IO Network's growth
- **Flexibility**: Redelegate to different gateways as conditions change
- **Low Barrier to Entry**: No technical expertise required
- **Transparent Rewards**: Clear visibility into reward distribution

## Getting Started

Ready to start earning rewards through delegated staking?

### **Step 1: Get ARIO Tokens**

You'll need ARIO tokens to delegate. These can be obtained through various exchanges or by participating in the network.

### **Step 2: Choose Your Gateway**

Research gateways on the [Gateway Portal](https://gateways.arweave.net/#/staking) to find one that matches your preferences for reward sharing and performance.

### **Step 3: Delegate Your Stake**

Use the Gateway Portal to delegate your tokens. The process is straightforward and your tokens remain secure throughout.

### **Step 4: Monitor Your Rewards**

Track your delegation performance and rewards through the portal's dashboard.

## Important Considerations

- **Gateway Performance**: Your rewards depend on the gateway's performance and observer selection
- **Reward Sharing**: Gateway operators set the percentage of rewards shared with delegators
- **Redelegation**: You can move your stake between gateways as network conditions change
- **Withdrawal Delays**: There may be delays when withdrawing your delegated stake
