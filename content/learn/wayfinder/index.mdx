# Wayfinder Protocol

## What is Wayfinder?

The Wayfinder protocol is a [URI scheme](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) designed to translate requests for Arweave content into `https://` requests. Essentially, Wayfinder allows for transforming traditional Arweave URLs like `https://arweave.net/long-txid` into more concise and user-friendly forms such as `ar://txid` or `ar://arns-name`.

When combined with the [AR.IO WayFinder browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ario-WayFinder/hnhmeknhajanolcoihhkkaaimapnmgil), the request can be directed to any number of functional [AR.IO Gateways](/learn/gateways/) to serve the content.

## How Wayfinder Works

### Transaction ID Resolution

To access content tied to an Arweave Transaction ID (TxId), simply append the TxId to `ar://`:

```
ar://qI19W6spw-kzOGl4qUMNp2gwFH2EBfDXOFsjkcNyK9A
```

Inputting this into a WayFinder-equipped browser will route your request through the right AR.IO Gateway, translating it as per your `Routing Method` settings.

### ArNS Name Resolution

Fetching content via an Arweave Name System (ArNS) name is straightforward. Attach the ArNS name to `ar://`:

```
ar://good-morning
```

The Wayfinder protocol, along with the WayFinder App, discerns between TxIds and ArNS names. Once the suitable `https://` request is formulated, the chosen gateway translates the ArNS name based on the ArNS aoComputer contract.

## Key Benefits

Using the Wayfinder Protocol offers several advantages over hardcoded links to a specific gateway:

1. **Flexibility**: Wayfinder links can be routed through any available AR.IO Gateway, ensuring content remains accessible even if a specific gateway is down or congested.

2. **Decentralization**: By not being tied to a single gateway, the Wayfinder Protocol embodies the decentralized spirit of the web, reducing potential censorship points.

3. **Ease of Maintenance**: Developers and content creators don't need to modify links if a gateway changes its URL or becomes unavailable. The WayFinder extension handles routing to an active gateway.

4. **Consistency**: Users always receive the same content, regardless of the gateway used, ensuring a consistent user experience.
