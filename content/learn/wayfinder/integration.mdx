# Integration Methods

## Browser Integration

The Wayfinder Protocol is currently facilitated via the WayFinder App or internal application integration. The intention is to lead popular web browsers like Chrome and Brave towards a direct integration of the Wayfinder Protocol, similar to recent integrations of the `ipfs://` protocol.

Such integration would remove the need for a client-side extension and boost developers' confidence in embedding Wayfinder Protocol URLs in their websites.

## Internal Application Integration

Certain websites or apps may want to resolve Arweave Transaction ID's (TxId) internally. In these scenarios, they can process the Wayfinder Protocol internally without depending on browser support or the WayFinder App.

A prime example is [opensea.io](https://opensea.io). Opensea, an NFT marketplace, frequently imports NFT metadata from external sources. If metadata employs the Wayfinder Protocol, Opensea internally resolves these, presenting content without redirecting users through an `https://` link.

## Resolution Approaches

There are two main approaches to resolving Wayfinder Protocol URLs:

### 1. Predefined Gateway Approach

Convert Wayfinder into a request directed at a predefined Arweave gateway. This approach is simple and reliable but ties your application to a specific gateway.

### 2. Dynamic Gateway Selection

Retrieve a list of active AR.IO Gateways from the [GAR](/learn/gateways/gateway-network#gateway-address-registry-gar) by reading the contract state, or other available resources, and then fetch content from a gateway on the list.

This approach provides better decentralization and fault tolerance but requires more complex implementation.

## SDK Integration Options

For developers looking to integrate Wayfinder functionality into their applications, AR.IO provides dedicated SDKs:

### Wayfinder Core

The [Wayfinder Core SDK](/sdks/wayfinder-core) provides the foundational functionality for resolving `ar://` URLs and interacting with AR.IO gateways. This SDK is ideal for custom implementations and server-side applications.

### Wayfinder React

The [Wayfinder React SDK](/sdks/wayfinder-react) offers React-specific components and hooks for building user interfaces that work seamlessly with the Wayfinder Protocol. Perfect for frontend applications and web interfaces.

Both SDKs handle the complexity of gateway selection, URL resolution, and error handling, making it easier to integrate Wayfinder functionality into your applications.

## Implementation Considerations

Each strategy has its benefits and challenges, necessitating careful evaluation based on specific use cases:

- **Performance**: Predefined gateways may be faster but less resilient
- **Decentralization**: Dynamic selection provides better decentralization
- **Complexity**: Predefined gateways are simpler to implement
- **Maintenance**: Dynamic selection requires ongoing gateway health monitoring
