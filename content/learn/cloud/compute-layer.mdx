# Compute Layer: AO

The compute layer comprises decentralized compute platforms that enable flexible, data-driven computation and smart contract execution on the permanent web.

## What is AO?

AO (Actor Oriented) is a decentralized compute platform native to Arweave that enables:

- **Smart contract execution** with permanent data access
- **Parallel processing** for high-performance applications
- **Message-based communication** between processes
- **Native integration** with Arweave's permanent storage

## Key Features

### Decentralized Computation

Processes run across multiple nodes, ensuring reliability and resistance to single points of failure.

### Data-Driven Architecture

Smart contracts can directly access and interact with data stored on Arweave, creating powerful data-driven applications.

### Flexible Execution

Support for various programming languages and execution environments, making it accessible to developers.

## How It Works

1. **Process Creation**: Developers deploy smart contracts as processes
2. **Message Handling**: Processes communicate through messages
3. **Data Access**: Direct access to Arweave data for computation
4. **Result Storage**: Computation results can be stored permanently

## Benefits for Developers

- **Permanent data access** - no need to re-download data
- **Scalable computation** - processes can scale as needed
- **Decentralized** - no single entity controls the network

## Next Steps
