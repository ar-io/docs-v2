# ARNS Routing

The **Arweave Name System (ArNS)** enables friendly, human-readable routing to Arweave transactions, making the permanent web as easy to use as the traditional internet. This system maps human-readable names to Arweave transaction IDs, providing subdomain routing for applications and enabling custom domains for permanent web content.

## What is ARNS?

ARNS is a decentralized naming system that works like DNS but for the permanent web. Instead of complex transaction IDs like `abc123...def789`, users can access content through friendly names like `myapp.arweave.net`. This creates memorable URLs that are bookmarkable, shareable, and provide a familiar web experience on the permanent web.

The system enables custom subdomains for different applications, path-based routing within applications, and version control through different subdomains. It supports multi-tenant applications with shared infrastructure while maintaining the decentralized nature of the permanent web.

## How ARNS Works

The Arweave Name System's state is managed by the ARIO token's smart contract, with ANT contracts handling individual name registrations. AR.IO gateways perform essential ARNS functions, actively tracking state changes in contracts and maintaining up-to-date indexes for routing configurations.

Gateways manage the expiration of stale records and facilitate ArNS routing based on the subdomains specified on incoming requests where appropriate. They provide custom HTTP response headers for ARNS requests, indicating the corresponding Arweave transaction ID.

## Key Features

ARNS provides human-readable URLs that replace complex transaction IDs with memorable, bookmarkable links that work forever. The system offers subdomain support for custom applications, path-based routing within applications, and version control through different subdomains.

The DNS-like functionality provides familiar addressing for web users, easy integration with existing applications, and standard HTTP protocols for compatibility. This creates browser-friendly URLs and bookmarks that work seamlessly with the permanent web.

## Benefits for Users

Users benefit from easy access through memorable URLs instead of long transaction IDs, bookmarkable links that work forever, and shareable addresses for permanent content. The system provides a familiar web experience on the permanent web with permanent resolution as long as names are registered.

The decentralized system has no single point of failure, provides automatic updates when content changes, and enables version control through different subdomains. This creates a reliable, permanent addressing system that works across the entire network.

## Benefits for Developers

Developers can integrate ARNS through standard HTTP requests for name resolution, easy API integration with existing applications, and custom domain support for branded applications. The system provides automatic updates when content changes and supports advanced features like custom headers with transaction information.

The platform includes metadata support for additional information, query parameters for dynamic content, and caching support for performance optimization. This makes it easy to build applications that leverage the permanent web without complex blockchain knowledge.

## Use Cases

ARNS enables permanent hosting with custom domains, version control through subdomain routing, and multi-tenant applications with shared infrastructure. Developers can create API endpoints with friendly names, blogs and websites with permanent URLs, and documentation sites that never go down.

The system supports media galleries with organized structure, educational content with stable links, and any application that benefits from permanent, human-readable addressing. This makes the permanent web accessible to users and developers familiar with traditional web technologies.
