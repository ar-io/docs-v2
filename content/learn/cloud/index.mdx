# The Permanent Cloud

The permanent web, or "permaweb," is the collection of all webpages, applications, and files stored on the Arweave network and made accessible by the AR.IO permanent cloud.

## What is the Permaweb?

The permaweb offers **low-cost, maintenance-free, and permanent hosting** for web apps, data, and pages. It serves both traditional and emerging industries with:

- **Immutable data storage** that lasts forever
- **Decentralized applications** with smart contract integration
- **Simple tools** for viewing and managing data
- **Sophisticated dApps** combining storage and computation

## The AR.IO Network Architecture

The AR.IO Network integrates decentralized protocols, services, and applications to power the permanent web alongside the traditional internet.

## Three-Layer Foundation

The permanent cloud is built on three essential layers:

### 1. **Storage Layer** → [Learn about Arweave](/learn/cloud/storage-layer)

Decentralized, immutable data storage that preserves information indefinitely with clear provenance records.

### 2. **Compute Layer** → [Explore AO](/learn/cloud/compute-layer)

Decentralized compute platforms enabling flexible, data-driven computation and smart contract execution.

### 3. **Services Layer** → [Discover AR.IO Services](/learn/cloud/services-layer)

Essential services like data upload, retrieval, indexing, querying, and domain name resolution.
