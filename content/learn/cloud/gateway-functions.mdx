# Gateway Functions

AR.IO gateways perform two main categories of functions to power the permanent web: **reading data** and **discovering data**. These core functions make it easier for users to interact with the Arweave network by simplifying the technical processes of accessing and finding information on the blockweave in a trust-minimized fashion.

## Reading Data

Gateways provide comprehensive data retrieval capabilities that span multiple types of information stored on Arweave. This includes retrieving transaction headers for base layer Arweave transactions, individual data chunks for specific transactions, and complete contiguous streams of chunks representing entire base layer transactions.

Beyond transaction data, gateways also retrieve blocks from the blockweave, storage pricing rates from the Arweave node network, and wallet information including token balances. They handle bundled data items following the ANS-104 specification, along with Layer 2 transactions and their relationships, enabling cross-referenced data access across different formats.

## Discovering Data

Gateways enable efficient data discovery through sophisticated indexing and querying capabilities. They examine incoming streams of data, including directly ingested transactions and data items, as well as blocks emitted by the chain. This data is managed in databases or analogous data stores, where it's indexed for fast retrieval.

The discovery process involves parsing and executing user queries efficiently, providing structured results for complex searches. Gateways facilitate friendly-path routing via Arweave manifest indexing, enabling users to access data through familiar web-style paths rather than complex transaction IDs.

## Additional Capabilities

Gateways integrate directly with the Arweave Name System (ArNS), facilitating friendly subdomain routing to Arweave transactions. This integration includes maintaining up-to-date indexes for routing configurations based on the state of the ARIO contract and the Arweave Name Token (ANT) contracts to which each name is affiliated.

The system manages the expiration of stale records and provides custom HTTP response headers for ArNS requests, indicating the corresponding Arweave transaction ID. Gateways also enable data sharing with other AR.IO gateways, creating a decentralized network that can handle shared workloads and provide redundancy.
