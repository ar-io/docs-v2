## Addressing Variable Market Conditions

The future market landscape is unpredictable, and the AR.IO Network smart contract is designed to be immutable, operating without governance or manual intervention. Using a pricing oracle to fix name prices relative to a stable currency is not viable due to the infancy of available solutions and reliance on external dependencies.

To address these challenges, ArNS is self-contained and adaptive, with name prices reflecting network activity and market conditions over time.

To achieve this, ArNS incorporates:

1. A **dynamic pricing model** that adjusts fees using a "Demand Factor" based on ArNS purchase activity
2. A **Returned Name Premium (RNP)** system that applies a timed, descending multiplier to registration prices for names that have recently expired or been returned to the protocol

This approach ensures that name valuations adapt to market conditions within the constraints of an immutable, maintenance-free smart contract framework.

## Dynamic Pricing Model

ArNS employs an adaptive pricing model to balance market demand with pricing fairness for name registration within the network. This model integrates static and dynamic elements, adjusting prices based on name length and purchase options like leasing, permanent acquisition, and undername amounts.

A key element is the **Demand Factor (DF)**, which dynamically adjusts prices according to network activity and revenue trends, ensuring prices reflect market conditions while remaining accessible and affordable.

A detailed description of the variables and formulas used for dynamic pricing can be found in the Appendix.

## Returned Name Premiums (RNP)

ArNS applies a **Returned Name Premium (RNP)** to names that re-enter the market after expiration or permanent return. This premium starts at a maximum value and decreases linearly over a predefined window, ensuring fair and transparent pricing for re-registered names.

The RNP multiplier is applied to the registration price of both permanently purchased and leased names.

## Gateway Operator ArNS Discount

Gateway operators who demonstrate consistent, healthy participation in the network are eligible for a **20% discount** on certain ArNS interactions.

### Qualification Requirements

To qualify for the discount:

- The gateway must maintain a "Gateway Performance Ratio Weight" (GPRW) of **0.85 or higher**
- The gateway must have a "Tenure Weight" (TW) of **0.5 or greater**, indicating at least a 3-month prior commitment to the network
- A gateway marked as "Leaving" shall not be eligible for this discount

### Eligible Discounted Interactions

- Purchasing a name
- Extending a lease
- Upgrading a lease to permabuy
- Increasing undernames capacity
