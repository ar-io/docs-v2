# Getting Started with AR.IO

Learn about AR.IO, Arweave, and the comprehensive ecosystem of tools available to developers for building on the permanent web.

## What is AR.IO?

AR.IO is a decentralized network that provides infrastructure for accessing and interacting with data stored on Arweave. It creates a robust, censorship-resistant gateway network that removes reliance on centralized services while ensuring high availability and performance.

## Learning Path

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Understand Arweave

    Start by learning about Arweave, the foundational layer that provides permanent data storage.

    - **Permanent Storage** - Data stored on Arweave is permanent and immutable
    - **Pay Once, Store Forever** - Single upfront payment for permanent storage
    - **Decentralized Network** - Distributed across thousands of miners globally
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Explore AR.IO Network

    Learn how AR.IO enhances Arweave with decentralized gateway infrastructure.

    - **Gateway Network** - Distributed access points for Arweave data
    - **ArNS (Arweave Name System)** - Human-readable names for Arweave data
    - **Incentivized Infrastructure** - Rewards for gateway operators
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Choose Your Tools

    Select the right tools and SDKs for your development needs.

    - **SDKs** - Pre-built libraries for easy integration
    - **APIs** - Direct REST endpoints for custom implementations
    - **Infrastructure** - Run your own gateway or use existing ones
  </Step>
</Steps>
