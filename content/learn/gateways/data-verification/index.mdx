## Data Verification

Gateway data verification is achieved by linking content hashes of transactions and data items to data roots on the Arweave base layer chain. 
Gateways index the chain from a trusted Arweave node and compute data roots for the base layer transaction data they download, ensuring that their data aligns with what was originally uploaded to Arweave. 
For base layer bundles that have already been verified, gateways compute hashes of individual data items, establishing a connection between the data root, the verified bundle, and the data items it contains. 
Gateways then expose these hashes and their verification status to users via HTTP headers on data responses.
