## Data Sharing

A key advantage and incentive for networked AR.IO gateways over standalone gateways is their ability to preferentially share various kinds of Arweave data among one another. 
Each gateway advertises its registered Arweave wallet address, so other network participants know who they are.  

Gateways can identify AR.IO Network peers by evaluating the Gateway Address Registry (GAR) within the AR.IO smart contract. 
They utilize that peer list to request as-yet-uncached data on behalf of their requesting clients or in service of their internal workflows. 
This can include requests for transaction header data, data items, and chunks. The Arweave Network shall act as the backstop for all block data, transaction header data, and chunk data. 

Additionally, gateways that receive requests for cache-missed data from other gateways can provide a higher quality of service to other AR.IO gateways than that which is provided to general users, apps, and infrastructure. 
However, gateways are not forced to share data with one another and can choose not to share their data if the intended recipient is acting maliciously. 
Such behaviors might include failure to reciprocate in data sharing, engaging in dishonest activities / observation, or distributing invalid data. 

## Data Verification

Gateway data verification is achieved by linking content hashes of transactions and data items to data roots on the Arweave base layer chain. 
Gateways index the chain from a trusted Arweave node and compute data roots for the base layer transaction data they download, ensuring that their data aligns with what was originally uploaded to Arweave. 
For base layer bundles that have already been verified, gateways compute hashes of individual data items, establishing a connection between the data root, the verified bundle, and the data items it contains. 
Gateways then expose these hashes and their verification status to users via HTTP headers on data responses.
