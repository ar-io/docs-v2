## What Are AR.IO Gateways?

AR.IO gateways are specialized infrastructure nodes that serve as bridges between the Arweave network and applications. They transform raw Arweave blockchain data into a fast, reliable, and developer-friendly platform for storing and retrieving permanent data.

## Core Responsibilities

AR.IO gateways handle three fundamental responsibilities:

### Data Writing & Proxying

- **Transaction relay**: Forward transaction headers to Arweave miners for mempool inclusion
- **Chunk distribution**: Proxy data chunks to Arweave nodes for storage and replication
- **Bundle processing**: Receive and bundle ANS-104 data items into base layer transactions

### Data Retrieval & Serving

- **Fast access**: Serve cached data with optimized performance and reliability
- **Multi-source fallback**: Retrieve data from trusted gateways, network peers, or directly from Arweave
- **Content delivery**: Stream complete transactions, individual chunks, or bundled data items

### Data Discovery & Indexing

- **Structured queries**: Enable efficient searches across transactions, bundles, and wallet data
- **Real-time indexing**: Process incoming data streams and maintain searchable databases
- **ArNS routing**: Provide human-readable name resolution for Arweave content

## Key Features

### Modular Architecture

Gateways are built with interchangeable components that operators can customize:

- **Configurable services**: Enable or disable features based on specific needs
- **Scalable storage**: From SQLite for small deployments to cloud databases for enterprise scale
- **Flexible infrastructure**: Adaptable to different operational environments and requirements

### Network Connectivity

- **Decentralized network**: Connect to other AR.IO gateways for data sharing and redundancy
- **Trust-minimized access**: Cryptographically verify data integrity without relying on central authorities
- **Performance optimization**: Intelligent caching and content delivery strategies

### Developer Experience

- **HTTP APIs**: Standard web interfaces for all gateway functionality
- **Monitoring & telemetry**: Built-in observability for operational insights
- **Content moderation**: Configurable policies for community and compliance needs

## What Gateways Are Not

It's important to understand the boundaries of what AR.IO gateways do and don't provide:

### Not Storage Providers

- **Don't enforce Arweave protocol**: Gateways don't validate consensus or mining rules
- **Don't guarantee permanence**: Storage permanence comes from Arweave itself, not gateways
- **Don't replicate all data**: Gateways cache popular content but aren't full blockchain replicas

### Not Compute Platforms

- **Don't depend on AO**: Gateways operate independently of any compute layer
- **Don't execute smart contracts**: Computation happens on AO or other platforms, not gateways
- **Don't process application logic**: Gateways focus purely on data access and delivery

### Not Centralized Services

- **Don't control data**: Content ownership and control remain with original creators
- **Don't gate access**: Anyone can run a gateway and access Arweave data
- **Don't create vendor lock-in**: Gateway APIs and protocols are open and interoperable
