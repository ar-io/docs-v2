# ArNS (Arweave Name System)

[ArNS](https://cookbook.bobinstein.com/fundamentals/accessing-arweave-data/arns.html) provides **human-readable URLs** for your Arweave data, making it easy to share and remember permanent addresses.

## What is ArNS?

ArNS is a naming system that allows you to register human-readable names that point to your Arweave transactions. Instead of sharing long transaction IDs, you can use memorable URLs.

**Example:**

- **Before:** `https://arweave.net/bVLEkL1SOPFCzIYi8T_QNnh17VlDp4RylU6YTwCMVRw`
- **After:** `https://myapp.arweave.net`

## How ArNS Works

**ANTs (Arweave Name Tokens)** are the key to owning an ArNS name. When you register an ArNS name to an ANT, the ANT becomes the transfer method for that name.

**Key Components:**

- **ArNS Names** - Human-readable identifiers (e.g., `myapp.arweave.net`)
- **ANTs** - Smart contracts that manage name ownership
- **Undernames** - Sub-domains managed by your ANT

## Getting Started

**Step 1: Register an ArNS Name**

- Visit the [ArNS App](https://arns.app)
- Connect a wallet
- Choose your desired name
- Pay the registration fee

**Step 2: Set Your Content**

- Point your ArNS name to a transaction ID
- Use undernames for additional content
- Manage your records through the ANT

## Using ArNS in Applications


```js
import axios from "axios";

// Fetch content from ArNS
const response = await axios.get("https://myapp.arweave.net/api/data");
console.log(response.data);
```

## Undernames

Create sub-domains under your main ArNS name:

**Examples:**

- `https://api_myapp.arweave.net`
- `https://docs_myapp.arweave.net`
- `https://assets_myapp.arweave.net`

**Benefits:**

- Transferred with the ANT
- Survive name changes
