# How to Access Data on Arweave

Once data is stored on Arweave, you need to know how to access it. Choose the method that best fits your needs.

## Getting Started

- [**HTTP Requests**](/how-to-access-data/http-requests) - Perfect for simple data retrieval
- [**GraphQL Queries**](/how-to-access-data/graphql-queries) - Recommended for developers
- [**ArNS**](/how-to-access-data/arns) - For human-readable URLs
- [**Wayfinder**](/how-to-access-data/wayfinder) - For advanced applications

## Why Access Methods Matter

Different access methods serve different purposes:

- **HTTP Requests** - Direct, simple access to any transaction
- **GraphQL Queries** - Powerful searching and filtering capabilities
- **ArNS** - Human-readable, permanent addressing
- **Wayfinder** - Decentralized, optimized content discovery

## Quick Start Guide

### **Need Simple Access? Start with HTTP Requests**

The easiest way to access data is through **HTTP requests** to gateways. Simply use the transaction ID in a URL:

```
https://arweave.net/your-transaction-id
```

Perfect for web applications, direct file access, and simple data retrieval.

### **For Developers: GraphQL Queries**

[GraphQL](https://arweave.net/graphql) provides powerful search and filtering capabilities for finding specific data:

- **Query by tags and metadata** - Find transactions by content type, app name, etc.
- **Complex filtering** - Filter by owner, block height, date ranges
- **Flexible data retrieval** - Get exactly the data you need

Perfect for applications that need to discover and filter data programmatically.

### **Want Human-Readable URLs? Use ArNS**

[ArNS](https://arns.app) provides **human-readable URLs** for your Arweave data:

- **Memorable addresses** - `myapp.arweave.net` instead of long transaction IDs
- **Permanent addressing** - URLs that never change
- **Easy sharing** - Share content with simple, memorable links

Perfect for websites, applications, and content that needs permanent, shareable URLs.

### **Advanced: Wayfinder for Production Apps**

[Wayfinder](https://github.com/ar-io/wayfinder) provides **decentralized, verified access** with automatic gateway selection:

- **Intelligent routing** - Automatically selects the best gateway
- **Data verification** - Cryptographically verifies data integrity
- **Production ready** - Built for scalable applications

Perfect for production applications requiring reliable, verified data access.

## Not Sure Which to Choose?

<Callout type="info">
  **Most users should start with HTTP Requests** for simple access or **GraphQL
  Queries** for application development. ArNS is perfect for permanent URLs, and
  Wayfinder is ideal for production applications.
