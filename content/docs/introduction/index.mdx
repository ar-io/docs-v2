# Introduction


AR.IO seeks to create a decentralized and incentivized cloud network aimed at attracting more gateways to the Arweave network therefore making the permanent web more accessible to all.
At the core of AR.IO's incentivization mechanism is the ARIO Token, a utility token used for joining the network, payments, gateway accountability, and protocol incentives.
The network features modular and composable gateway infrastructure in addition to the [Arweave Name System (ArNS)](/arns) - a system for assigning friendly domain names to permanent data.
