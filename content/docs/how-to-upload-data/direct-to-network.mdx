# Upload Data Directly to Arweave

Upload data directly to Arweave nodes using **arweave-js** - the most advanced approach requiring careful consideration of trade-offs.

## Are You Building a Production Application?

<Callout type="warning">
**For Most Applications:** We recommend [Turbo bundling](/how-to-upload-data/bundling-services) instead. Direct uploads are risky for scaled applications due to inconsistent IDs, manual verification requirements, and slower indexing.
</Callout>

## For Advanced Use Cases: Direct Network Access

Direct uploads use **arweave-js** to upload data as L1 transactions directly to Arweave nodes. Each upload gets a unique transaction ID with no consistency guarantees.

## Get Started with Direct Uploads

<Steps>
<Step>
### Install arweave-js

```bash
npm install arweave
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Set Up Your Wallet

Create a new wallet or use an existing one:

```bash
# Create a new wallet (easy way)
npx permaweb/wallet > key.json
```

Then load it in your code:

```js
import Arweave from "arweave";
import fs from "fs";

// Initialize Arweave instance
const arweave = Arweave.init({
  host: "arweave.net",
  port: 443,
  protocol: "https",
});

// Load your wallet
const wallet = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync("./key.json", "utf-8"));
```
</Step>

<Step>
### Fund Your Wallet with AR Tokens

You must have AR tokens to pay for transactions:

```js
// Check your AR balance
const address = await arweave.wallets.jwkToAddress(wallet);
const balance = await arweave.wallets.getBalance(address);
const arBalance = arweave.ar.winstonToAr(balance);

console.log(`AR Balance: ${arBalance} AR`);
```

**Note:** You need AR tokens for transaction fees. Buy AR on exchanges like Binance, Kraken, or use [Turbo](#) for fiat payments.
</Step>

<Step>
### Upload Your Data

<CodeGroup>
```js tab="Upload File"
// Upload a file
const data = fs.readFileSync("./myfile.jpg");

const transaction = await arweave.createTransaction(
  {
    data: data,
  },
  wallet
);

// Add tags
transaction.addTag("Content-Type", "image/jpeg");
transaction.addTag("Title", "My Image");

// Sign and submit
await arweave.transactions.sign(transaction, wallet);
const response = await arweave.transactions.post(transaction);

console.log("Transaction ID:", transaction.id);
console.log("Response:", response.status);
```

```js tab="Upload Raw Data"
// Upload raw data (string, JSON, etc.)
const data = JSON.stringify({
  message: "Hello Arweave!",
  timestamp: Date.now(),
});

const transaction = await arweave.createTransaction(
  {
    data: data,
  },
  wallet
);

// Add tags
transaction.addTag("Content-Type", "application/json");
transaction.addTag("App-Name", "MyApp");

// Sign and submit
await arweave.transactions.sign(transaction, wallet);
const response = await arweave.transactions.post(transaction);

console.log("Transaction ID:", transaction.id);
console.log("Response:", response.status);
```
</CodeGroup>

**⚠️ Important:** You must manually verify the transaction was mined and seeded across nodes.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Why Direct Network is Risky for Production

Direct uploads come with significant challenges that make them unsuitable for most applications.

<Callout type="note">
**Perfect for:** Specialized use cases, research projects, custom protocol implementations, and applications that need maximum control over every aspect of the upload process.
</Callout>

| Issue | Direct Network | Turbo Bundling |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Transaction IDs** | Different ID every upload | Consistent data item IDs |
| **Upload Guarantees** | No guarantees it works | Built-in redundancy & retries |
| **Manual Verification** | Must verify seeding manually | Automatic verification |
| **Indexing Speed** | Slow to appear in GraphQL | Optimistically indexed & cached |
| **Payment** | AR tokens only | Fiat + multiple tokens |
| **Error Handling** | Manual implementation | Built-in retry logic |

<Callout type="warning">
**Production Risk:** Each piece of data uploaded as L1 gets different transaction IDs, making it impossible to predict data addresses. You must manually verify that transactions are mined and properly seeded across Arweave nodes.
</Callout>
