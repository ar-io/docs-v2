# What is an AR.IO Gateway?

AR.IO Gateways are the **workhorses of the AR.IO Network** - they act as bridges between the Arweave network and the outside world, making the permanent web accessible to everyone.

## The Problem AR.IO Gateways Solve

**Traditional Arweave access requires:**

- Technical knowledge of transaction IDs
- Complex data retrieval processes
- Limited querying capabilities
- Single points of failure

**AR.IO Gateways provide:**

- Simple HTTP access to any data
- Powerful search and indexing
- Reliable, distributed infrastructure
- User-friendly interfaces

## Core Gateway Functions

### Writing Data

- **Proxy transactions** to Arweave miners
- **Bundle data items** for efficient storage
- **Facilitate uploads** with multiple payment options

### Reading Data

- **Retrieve transaction headers** and data chunks
- **Serve blocks** from the blockweave
- **Provide storage pricing** information
- **Stream complete transactions**

### Discovering Data

- **Index and query** transaction data
- **Parse user queries** efficiently
- **Manage search databases**
- **Enable content discovery**

## AR.IO Gateway Benefits

**Beyond basic Arweave gateways, AR.IO gateways offer:**

- **Modular architecture** - Customize for your needs
- **Telemetry integration** - Built-in monitoring
- **ArNS integration** - Friendly domain routing
- **Content moderation** - Configurable policies
- **Network connectivity** - Data sharing with other gateways

## Gateway Modularity

AR.IO gateways are designed to be **modular and configurable**:

**Small Scale:**

- SQLite databases
- Local file storage
- Minimal resource usage

**Large Scale:**

- PostgreSQL/Cassandra
- S3-compatible storage
- Cloud-native deployment

**Services can be:**

- Turned on/off as needed
- Customized for specific use cases
- Scaled independently

## ArNS Integration

AR.IO gateways provide **friendly domain routing** through the Arweave Name System:

- **Track contract state** changes
- **Maintain routing indexes** for ArNS names
- **Manage record expiration**
- **Route subdomain requests**
- **Provide transaction ID headers**

## Network Participation

**Join the AR.IO Network to:**

- **Share data** with other gateways
- **Earn rewards** for quality service
- **Participate in governance**
- **Access network benefits**
