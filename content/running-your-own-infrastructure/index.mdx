# Running Your Own Infrastructure

Take control of the permanent web by running your own **Arweave infrastructure**. Build and deploy various components to participate in the decentralized network that powers the permaweb.

## Infrastructure Components

**AR.IO infrastructure includes multiple components:**

- **AR.IO Gateways** - Serve and index data from Arweave
- **Bundlers** - Package and submit data to Arweave efficiently
- **And more** - Additional infrastructure components as the network grows

## Deployment Options

**Most infrastructure components can be deployed in two ways:**

- **Standalone** - Run independently for specialized services
- **Gateway Extension** - Integrate with your AR.IO gateway for enhanced functionality
