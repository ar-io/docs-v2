# What is a Bundler?

AR.IO Bundlers are **data packaging services** that efficiently bundle multiple data items and submit them to Arweave as single transactions, reducing costs and improving reliability.

## The Problem Bundlers Solve

**Individual Arweave transactions have limitations:**

- **High costs** for small data items
- **Network congestion** from many small transactions
- **Reliability issues** with individual submissions

**Bundlers provide:**

- **Cost optimization** through batching
- **Improved reliability** with retry mechanisms
- **Simplified payments** with multiple options
- **Better performance** for high-volume uploads

## How Bundling Works

### ANS-104 Standard

AR.IO Bundlers use the [ANS-104 specification](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-104.md):

- **Data Items** - Individual pieces of data to be stored
- **Bundle** - Single Arweave transaction containing multiple data items
- **Efficient Storage** - Reduces transaction overhead
- **Cost Savings** - Pay once for multiple items

### Bundling Process

1. **Collect Data Items** - Gather multiple uploads
2. **Package Bundle** - Combine items using ANS-104 format
3. **Sign Bundle** - Create single Arweave transaction
4. **Submit to Network** - Send to Arweave miners
5. **Track Status** - Monitor submission progress

## AR.IO Bundler Features

**Core capabilities:**

- **ANS-104 Compliance** - Standard bundling format
- **Multiple Payment Options** - AR, ETH, credit cards, Turbo Credits
- **Retry Mechanisms** - Automatic retry on failures
- **Status Tracking** - Real-time upload progress
- **Cost Optimization** - Batch processing for efficiency

**Security features:**

- **Wallet Whitelisting** - Control who can upload
- **Signature Verification** - Validate data authenticity
- **Access Control** - Configurable permissions

## Open Source Implementation

**AR.IO Bundlers are based on the [Turbo Upload Service](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-upload-service):**

- **Open Source** - Full source code available
- **Production Ready** - Used by Turbo service
- **Well Maintained** - Active development
- **Extensible** - Customizable for your needs

**Key components:**

- **Upload Service** - Accepts incoming data
- **Fulfillment Service** - Handles Arweave submission
- **Database** - PostgreSQL for state management
- **Object Store** - S3-compatible storage
- **Job Queues** - SQS for async processing

## Payment Integration

**Bundlers can integrate with payment services:**

- **Turbo Payment Service** - [Open source payment processing example](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-payment-service) (requires custom integration)
- **Custom Solutions** - Build your own payment integration (no integration guides available)

## Deployment Options

**AR.IO Bundlers can be deployed in two ways:**

### Standalone Bundler

- **Independent Service** - Run separately from gateways
- **Turbo Upload Service** - Use the [Turbo Upload Service](https://github.com/ardriveapp/turbo-upload-service) directly
- **Specialized Focus** - Dedicated to bundling operations
- **Scalable Architecture** - Handle high-volume uploads

### Gateway Extension

- **Integrated Service** - Part of your AR.IO gateway
- **Docker Compose Setup** - Use docker-compose.bundler.yaml from AR.IO node
- **Unified Interface** - Single endpoint for all operations
- **Shared Resources** - Use gateway infrastructure
