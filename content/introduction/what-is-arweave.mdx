# What is Arweave?

Arweave is **permanent information storage** - a decentralized web inside an open ledger, like Bitcoin but for data.

## The Problem

Traditional web storage is fragile. Websites disappear, data gets lost, and centralized servers create single points of failure. The internet's history is constantly being erased.

## The Solution

Arweave creates a **permanent, decentralized web** where information is stored forever. Once data is uploaded to Arweave, it's replicated across hundreds of nodes and guaranteed to be available for hundreds of years.

## Why It Matters

- **Permanent**: Data stored once, available forever
- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- **Censorship-resistant**: No one can take it down
- **Cost-effective**: Pay once, store forever
