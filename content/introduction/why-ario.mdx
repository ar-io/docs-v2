# Why AR.IO?

Arweave offers permanent data storage, but lacks modern application needs.

## The Problem

Arweave doesn't include data indexing, querying, or retrieval services.

## The Current State

Infrastructure services exist but are:

- Closed source
- Complex codebases
- Expensive to operate

## The Bottleneck

The community relies on a single gateway: arweave.net.

This creates a single point of failure for the entire ecosystem.

## The AR.IO Solution

AR.IO provides open source, efficient gateway software that's easy to run and not resource intensive.

## Two-Pronged Approach

1. **Open source architecture** - Simple, modular, efficient
2. **Economic incentives** - ARIO Token rewards for network participation

## The Result

A healthy, sustainable, decentralized gateway network that's already operational.
