# Why AR.IO ?

Arweave (a Layer 1 blockchain network) offers scalable and permanent onchain data storage in a sustainable manner.
It does this by incentivizing miner nodes through a tokenomic endowment model which ensures data is globally stored and replicated for hundreds of years without the need for continual payment or maintenance by its uploader.

However, the Arweave protocol does not incorporate all the needs of modern applications like data indexing, querying, retrieval, and other vital services.
Consequently, over the past few years, infrastructure services have been independently developed and deployed to meet the demands of the permaweb at scale.
Users and apps have come to rely on these gateway utilities, but they are closed source, have complex codebases, and are expensive to operate.

Arweave does not offer any tokenomic incentives to offset the expenses associated with operating a gateway, which has led to the community's reliance on a single centrally controlled gateway subsidized for the betterment of the network: arweave.net.
While arweave.net currently caches and indexes the entire weave with a high quality of service, it is a single bottleneck and point of failure for the whole ecosystem.

AR.IO seeks to reduce the barriers of entry and attract more gateway operators to the permaweb with the goal of further enhancing its overall health, resiliency, and functionality through decentralized mechanisms that are as trustless as possible.

The solution will be applied in two directions:

    1. By reducing gateway overhead costs with open source, efficient, modular networked architecture.

    2. By creating an economic incentive layer with the ARIO Token.

The overall goal of this white paper is to present the framework for a healthy and sustainable decentralized gateway network.
