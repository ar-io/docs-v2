# What is AR.IO

AR.IO is the world's first permanent cloud network, providing the infrastructure to ensure data, applications, and digital identities are timeless, tamper-proof, and universally accessible.
Built on the foundation of the Arweave storage network, AR.IO forms a global ecosystem of gateways, protocols, and services that connect users to the permaweb â€“ a web where information is permanent and free from centralized control.

The [AR.IO Network](/network-composition) is an open, distributed, and ownerless system, supported by operators, developers, and end-users from around the world.
It's decentralized nodes, known as [AR.IO Gateways](/gateways), act as "Permanent Cloud Service Providers" delivering the critical services needed to read, write, index and query data stored on the permaweb.
These gateways provide a unified, resilient interface between users and the permaweb, featuring a permanent domain name system and seamless, location-independent access to permanent storage and applications.

Gateways operate using standardized protocols to maintain consistency across the network.
They also engage in an [observation and reporting protocol](/gateways/observer) to monitor performance and ensure accountability, helping to maintain a healthy and reliable ecosystem.

The AR.IO Network is powered by a [utility token](/token), ARIO, which drives the network's functionality and accessibility.
ARIO serves as a currency for services such as the Arweave Name System (ArNS), staking to join the network as a gateway operator, delegated staking, and as rewards for contributing to the network's performance and reliability.

Together, these elements form the backbone of a permanent cloud network designed to preserve data and expand the possibilities of the web.
