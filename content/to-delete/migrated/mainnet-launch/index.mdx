## Overview

The AR.IO Network has migrated from testnet to mainnet. While most of the transition is seamless, there are a few specific steps that participants need to take to ensure a smooth migration.

## Gateway Operators

Gateway operators will not need to modify any configuration settings to migrate to the mainnet. Everything will be handled automatically via gateway Release 27. Every 
gateway operator will need to update their gateway to Release 27 and restart the gateway as soon as possible, or they will continue to operate on testnet. 

Release 27 will become available once the mainnet ARIO contract is officially deployed to the AO network. Gateway operators cannot migrate until this happens.

Transferring a gateway to another server will not affect mainnet migration in any way, provided that the transfer is completed properly.

## ArNS Name Holders

ArNS name holders will not need to take any action to migrate to mainnet. Existing [ANTs](/arns#arweave-name-token-ant) will continue to work on mainnet and will not need to be forked or updated.
However, an optional upgrade to the ANT contract is available for those who want to take advantage of new features. This upgrade can be completed via the name management page at [arns.app](https://arns.arweave.net/#/manage/names)

## SDK Developers

SDK developers will need to update their SDKs to the latest version ([3.8.0](/ar-io-sdk/release-notes)). This is a non-breaking change, so existing code will continue to work. However, the process Id for the ARIO mainnet contract has changed. This means that
failure to update will result in code continuing to operate on testnet.

The basic [`init()`](/ar-io-sdk/ario/configuration) method automatically provides this process Id. If you are using advanced configuration methods, you will need to manually update the process Id.

* testnet Process Id: `agYcCFJtrMG6cqMuZfskIkFTGvUPddICmtQSBIoPdiA`
* mainnet Process Id: `qNvAoz0TgcH7DMg8BCVn8jF32QH5L6T29VjHxhHqqGE`
