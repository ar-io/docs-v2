- **ArNS Resolution** - Resolve human-readable names to Arweave transaction IDs
- **Network Information** - Query gateway health, pricing, and network status
- **Transaction Management** - Submit and track transactions
- **Admin Functions** - Gateway administration and configuration

## Turbo APIs

Turbo provides high-performance upload services for the Arweave network with additional features:

- **Data Upload** - Fast, reliable uploads with instant confirmation
- **Payment Processing** - Transparent pricing and payment management
- **Upload Tracking** - Monitor upload status and metadata
- **Credit Management** - Handle payment credits and billing

## Open Source Commitment

We believe strongly in open source development. All AR.IO services are:

- **Publicly Available** - Source code is open and accessible
- **AGPL-3 Licensed** - Ensuring software freedom and transparency
- **Community Driven** - Built with input from the developer community
- **Auditable** - Code can be reviewed and verified by anyone
