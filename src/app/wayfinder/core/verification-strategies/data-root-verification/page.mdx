# DataRootVerificationStrategy

## Overview

The `DataRootVerificationStrategy` provides the highest level of data integrity verification by validating data using Arweave's Merkle tree proofs. This strategy ensures maximum security by verifying that the data matches the cryptographic data root stored in the transaction, providing mathematical proof of data integrity.

<Tip title="Important">
  `DataRootVerificationStrategy` requires that the trusted gateway has the relevant
  transaction data indexed locally. Gateways cannot proxy out verification
  requests to other sources, as this would compromise the security and
  reliability of the verification process. If a gateway doesn't have the
  required data indexed, verification will fail.
</Tip>




## How It Works

1. **Compute Data Root**: Chunk the received content and build a Merkle tree
2. **Calculate Root Hash**: Compute the root hash of the Merkle tree
3. **Fetch Trusted Root**: Get the data root from trusted gateways via `/tx/{txId}/data_root`
4. **Compare Roots**: Verify the calculated root matches the trusted data root
5. **Result**: Pass or fail based on data root validation

<Tip title="Warning">
  **ANS-104 Data Items Not Supported**: This strategy currently only works with regular Arweave transactions, not ANS-104 bundled data items. If you attempt to verify an ANS-104 data item, it will throw an error.
</Tip>

## Basic Usage

```javascript
import { DataRootVerificationStrategym, Wayfinder } from '@ar.io/wayfinder-core'

const wayfinder = new Wayfinder({ /* ...global wayfinder configuration */  });
const verificationStrategy = new DataRootVerificationStrategy({
  trustedGateways: [new URL('https://arweave.net')],
})

// use it in a request
const verifiedData = await wayfinder.request('ar://<some-tx-id', {
  verificationSettings: {
    enabled: true,
    strategy: verificationStrategy,
    strict: true // block the flow of bytes until verification has passed
    events: {
      onVerificationProgress: (e) => {
        console.debug('Verification progress: ${ e.processBytes / e.totalBytes * 100}%)
      },
      onVerificationFailed: (e) => {
        console.error('Verification failed!, e)
      },
      onVerificationSucceeded: (e) => {
        console.log('Verification succeeded!, e)
      }
    }
  }
})
```
