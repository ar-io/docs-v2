# Wayfinder

Wayfinder is a client-side routing and verification protocol that provides decentralized, cryptographically verified access to data stored on Arweave via the [AR.IO Network](/gateways). It automatically selects optimal gateways and ensures data integrity for seamless permaweb experiences.

## What is Wayfinder?

Wayfinder solves the challenge of reliable data access on the permaweb by:

- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically selects the best gateway for each request based on performance, availability, and user preferences
- **Data Verification**: Cryptographically verifies data integrity to ensure you're getting authentic, unmodified content
- **Decentralized Access**: Eliminates single points of failure by distributing requests across multiple AR.IO gateways
- **Seamless Integration**: Works behind the scenes to provide fast, reliable access without requiring users to understand the underlying infrastructure

## Who is Wayfinder For?

### Builders

_People who build dApps on the permaweb_

Wayfinder enables developers to build robust decentralized applications with:

- **Reliable Data Access**: Never worry about gateway downtime or slow responses
- **Built-in Verification**: Ensure data integrity without implementing complex verification logic
- **Developer-Friendly APIs**: Simple JavaScript/TypeScript libraries and React components
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in telemetry to track and optimize application performance
- **Flexible Configuration**: Choose routing strategies and verification methods that fit your use case

### Browsers

_People who browse the permaweb_

Wayfinder provides end users with:

- **Fast Loading**: Automatically routes to the fastest available gateway for optimal performance
- **Reliable Access**: Seamlessly switches between gateways if one becomes unavailable
- **Data Integrity**: Verifies that content hasn't been tampered with or corrupted
- **Transparent Operation**: Works invisibly in the background without requiring user interaction
- **No Tokens Required**: Access permaweb content without needing AR tokens or wallet connections

### Operators

_People who operate AR.IO gateways_

Wayfinder helps gateway operators by:

- **Performance Insights**: Provides telemetry data to help optimize gateway performance
- **Network Participation**: Enables gateways to participate in the decentralized routing ecosystem
- **Load Distribution**: Intelligently distributes traffic based on gateway capabilities and performance
- **Quality Monitoring**: Tracks gateway reliability and performance metrics
- **Network Health**: Contributes to overall AR.IO network resilience and performance

## What Can Wayfinder Do?

### Routing Strategies

- **Fastest Ping**: Selects gateways with the lowest latency for optimal performance
- **Preferred with Fallback**: Uses trusted gateways first, with automatic fallback options
- **Round Robin**: Distributes requests evenly to balance load across gateways
- **Random**: Provides simple load distribution for basic use cases

### Verification Methods

- **Hash Verification**: Compares data against trusted gateway hashes for quick integrity checks
- **Signature Verification**: Validates Arweave transaction signatures for cryptographic proof
- **Data Root Verification**: Verifies data against blockchain-recorded transaction roots


### Monitoring & Observability

- **Real-time Events**: Track routing decisions, verification results, and performance metrics
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Standard telemetry for integration with existing monitoring tools
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed insights into gateway performance and user experience
