# Testnet

The AR.IO Network Testnet allows developers to test their applications and workflows using AR.IO Network features such as [ArNS Names](/arns) before deploying to the mainnet. The AR.IO Network Testnet offers a faucet for requesting testnet ARIO tokens (tARIO). The initial version of testnet only supports registering and resolving temporary ArNS names; however, enhancements such as temporary data uploads will be added in the future. We welcome feedback for improvements and other feature requests.

## Restrictions

Testnet has a few primary purposes: to mimic mainnet functionality as close as possible, to provide a testing bed for upcoming network upgrades, and to provide a playground for users and developers to experiment. It is NOT intended for production purposes and should not be used as such.
Test ARIO (tARIO) tokens are just that - test tokens. They have no external value, may break, and have no guarantee of continued support. tARIO tokens have no relation to mainnet $ARIO and are not a proxy for any rewards. There is no supply cap on tARIO tokens.
While advanced notice will be provided whenever possible, testnet may go offline for maintenance. Likewise, test token balances and test ArNS names may be reset/nullified at any point to clean up the contract state or prepare for an upgrade.

## Faucet

### Browser UI

The AR.IO Network Testnet Faucet is a service that allows developers to request testnet ARIO tokens (tARIO). It can be accessed in a browser by visiting [ar://faucet](https://faucet.arweave.net).

To use it:

1. Select Testnet from the Process ID dropdown
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Enter an amount of tARIO tokens
4. Complete the captcha challenge
5. Click the "Request Tokens" button
6. Once complete, tARIO tokens will automatically be sent to your wallet

### Programmatic Access

The faucet service supports both synchronous and asynchronous workflows for claiming tokens.

> **Note**: Direct faucet access in the [ARIO SDK](/ar-io-sdk) is coming soon.

#### Process IDs

- Testnet: `qNvAoz0TgcH7DMg8BCVn8jF32QH5L6T29VjHxhHqqGE`

#### Synchronous Workflow

For simple, one-off token claims:

```bash
curl -X POST https://faucet.ario.permaweb.services/api/claim/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "captchaResponse": "<captcha-response>",
    "recipient": "<recipient-address>",
    "qty": "<quantity>"
  }'
```

#### Asynchronous Workflow

For applications that need to request tokens for multiple wallets:

```bash
# Request authorization token
curl -X GET https://faucet.ario.permaweb.services/api/token/request?process-id=qNvAoz0TgcH7DMg8BCVn8jF32QH5L6T29VjHxhHqqGE

# Claim tokens with authorization token
curl -X POST https://faucet.ario.permaweb.services/api/claim/async \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>" \
  -d '{
    "processId": "qNvAoz0TgcH7DMg8BCVn8jF32QH5L6T29VjHxhHqqGE",
    "recipient": "<recipient_address>",
    "qty": <qty>
  }'
```

Rate limits:
- Global: 10 requests per hour
- Captcha: 1 request per hour

## Using Testnet

Using the testnet is similar to using the mainnet, with a few key differences:

### Using ar://arns

[ar://arns](https://arns.arweave.net) is the primary UI for purchasing and managing ArNS names on the AR.IO Network. ar://arns can be configured to operate on the AR.IO Network Testnet in the "ArNS Registry Settings".

To do so: 

1. Connect a wallet to ar://arns by clicking on the "Connect" button at the top right of the page
2. Once connected, click on the wallet profile icon that replaced the "Connect" button
3. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu
4. Select "ArNS Registry Settings" from the options
5. Select "Testnet" from the available networks

### Using the ARIO SDK

When using the [ARIO SDK](/ar-io-sdk), you must instantiate the `ARIO` class with the appropriate process ID for testnet. The SDK includes the following exports for convenience:

```typescript
import { ARIO, ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID } from '@ar.io/sdk';

// For testnet
const ario = new ARIO({ processId: ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID });
```

> **Note**: [ANTs](/ants/#arweave-name-token-ant) are network-agnostic, so no additional configuration is needed when working with them.

Once configured, all SDK methods will operate on the specified network instead of mainnet. For more details on configuration, see the [ARIO Configuration](/ar-io-sdk/ario/configuration) documentation.

### Accessing ArNS Names

To access ArNS names on testnet in a browser, you must use a gateway that is configured to operate on the testnet instead of mainnet.

The [ar-io.dev](https://ar-io.dev) gateway is configured to operate on the AR.IO Network Testnet.
