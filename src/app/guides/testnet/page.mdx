# Testnet

The ARIO Network Testnet allows developers to test their applications and workflows using ARIO Network features such as [ArNS Names](/arns) before deploying to the mainnet. The ARIO Network Testnet offers a faucet for requesting testnet ARIO tokens (tARIO).

## Faucet

### Browser UI

The ARIO Network Testnet Faucet is a service that allows developers to request testnet ARIO tokens (tARIO). It can be accessed in a browser by visiting [ar://faucet](https://faucet.arweave.net).

This is the recommended way to use the faucet. To use it:

1. Select Testnet from the network dropdown
2. Enter your wallet address
3. Enter the number of tARIO tokens you would like to request
4. Complete the captcha challenge
5. Click the "Request Tokens" button

## Using Testnet

Using the testnet is similar to using the mainnet, with a few key differences:

### Using the ARIO SDK

When using the [ARIO SDK](/ar-io-sdk), you must instantiate the `ARIO` class with the appropriate process ID for testnet. The SDK includes the following exports for convenience:

```typescript
import { ARIO, ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID } from '@ar.io/sdk'

// For testnet
const ario = new ARIO({ processId: ARIO_TESTNET_PROCESS_ID })
```

> **Note**: [ANTs](/arns#arweave-name-token-ant) are network-agnostic, so no additional configuration is needed when working with them.

Once configured, all SDK methods will operate on testnet instead of mainnet. For more details on configuration, see the [ARIO Configuration](/ar-io-sdk/ario/configuration) documentation.

### Accessing ArNS Names

To access ArNS names on testnet in a browser, you must use a gateway that is configured to operate on testnet instead of mainnet.

The gateway [ar-io.dev](https://ar-io.dev) is configured to operate on the ARIO Network Testnet.
