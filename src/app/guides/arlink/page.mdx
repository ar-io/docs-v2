# Arlink Deploy

## Overview

Arlink is a third party tool that allows you to permanently deploy and manage web apps on the permaweb with ease. 

## How it works

Users can link their Github or [Protocol.land](https://protocol.land/) repositories to their Arlink account through the [Arlink dashboard.](https://arlink.arweave.net/dashboard) When a new project or build is deployed, 
Arlink will take the repository, build it, and upload the build folder to Arweave.

Arlink also allows users to connect their project to an [ArNS](/arns) name they own, or an undername of the ArNS name [ar://arlink.](https://arlink.arweave.net)

## Dashboard

After connecting your wallet to the Arlink web app using the button at the top right, you will be taken to your dashboard. This page will display any deployments associated with your wallet, and includes a "+ New Deployment" button 
in order to start the process of deploying a new project.

## New Deployment

After clicking on the new deployment button, you will be prompted to import a repository from either Github or Protocol.land.

### Authorize Github

If this is your first time importing from Github, you will be prompted to authorize Arlink to access your Github repositories. You can authorize all repositories, or limit authorization to any number of specific ones.

### Select Repository

Once authorization is approved, select which repository and branch you want to deploy.

### Define Build and Output Steps

Once you select what you want to deploy, you need to specify how the project needs to be built to get it ready. Arlink prompts for five inputs:

- ***Project Name***: This is the name of your project.

- ***Install Command***: The command for installing dependencies for your project. Usually `npm install` or `yarn install`

- ***Build Command***: This is the command to run your build script. Usually `npm run build` or `yarn build`

- ***Sub Directory***: If the front end for your project lives in a sub directory of your selected repository, you can specify that here.

- ***Output Directory***: This is the path to the build folder being deployed. This will be different depending on the framework your project uses.

### Select ArNS

The last thing to do is select an ArNS name to deploy your project to. If you own your own name, you can connect to it here with the "Use existing ArNS" toggle. Otherwise, you can select an undername of the ArNS name `arlink` to deploy to.
Duplicate undernames cannot exist, so you can only select an undername that is not already being used.

### Logs

Once you select your ArNS name and click "Deploy", your project will be deployed. Logs from the build and deploy process will be displayed so you can monitor for errors.

## Updates

To deploy a new build of your project, select it from the dashboard.

The project page gives you the option to update any settings or configurations, and has a "Deploy Latest" button which will redeploy your project.
