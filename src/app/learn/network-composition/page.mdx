# AR.IO Network composition

## Overview

The permanent web, or "permaweb," is the collection of all webpages, applications, and files stored on the Arweave network and made accessible by the AR.IO permanent cloud. 
These range from simple tools for viewing and managing data to sophisticated decentralized applications integrating immutable storage and smart contracts. 

For users and developers, the permaweb offers low-cost, maintenance-free, and permanent hosting for web apps, data, and pages â€“ serving both traditional and emerging industries. 

## Composition of the Permanent Cloud

The AR.IO Network integrates decentralized protocols, services, and applications to power the permanent web alongside the traditional internet. 
Foundational components like Arweave and AO are independently developed, while AR.IO introduces essential services and incentives that enable seamless interaction and accessibility.

Major Components of the Permanent Cloud: 

    1. **Storage: Arweave** 

        At the foundation lies the Arweave protocol, providing decentralized, immutable data storage. This layer ensures data is preserved indefinitely with clear provenance records for long-term reliability. 

    2. **Compute: AO** 

        This layer comprises decentralized compute platforms, such as Arweave-native solutions like AO and other Layer 1 smart contract platforms like Ethereum. 
        These systems enable flexible, data-driven computation and smart contract execution, broadening the ecosystem's capabilities. 

    3. **Services: AR.IO** 

        Sitting atop the compute layer, the AR.IO Network provides essential services like data upload, retrieval, indexing, querying, and domain name resolution. 
        AR.IO gateways ensure the permanent web remains functional, accessible, and usable for developers, creators, and end users. 

 

Together, these layers form a cohesive ecosystem, combining data permanence, decentralized computation, and seamless cloud services. 
Each layer strengthens the others, creating a resilient foundation for the permaweb while bridging the traditional and decentralized internet paradigms.
