# The ARIO Token

{/* **NOTE**: The ARIO Token and its associated functions are still in development and have not yet been released. The currently available testnet version of the token is referred to as `tARIO`. */}

## Overview

ARIO is the multifunction [AO Computer](/learn/glossary#ao-computer-ao) based token that powers the AR.IO Network and its suite of permanent cloud applications. The ARIO Token uses include: 

   - **Gateway Participation**: Gateway operators must stake ARIO tokens to join and actively participate in the network. 

   - **Eligibility for Protocol Rewards**: Both individuals who stake tokens as gateway operators and those who delegate tokens to a gateway are positioned to receive protocol rewards. 

   - **ArNS Name Purchases**: Acquiring friendly names through the [Arweave Name System](/learn/arns) (ArNS) requires ARIO tokens. These transactions directly contribute to the protocol, with the proceeds being redistributed through the [Observation and Incentive Protocol](/build/gateways/observer). 

   - **Universal Currency**: Within the AR.IO ecosystem, ARIO tokens serve as a versatile currency, enabling network participants to make purchases and exchange value. 

Moreover, ARIO tokens play a crucial role in driving ecosystem growth, fueling incentive programs, investments, bounties, and grants designed for active participants.
