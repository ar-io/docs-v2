# Parquet and ClickHouse Usage Guide

## What is Parquet?

Apache Parquet is a columnar storage file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. Unlike row-based storage formats like SQLite, Parquet organizes data by column rather than by row, which provides several advantages for analytical workloads:

- **Efficient compression**: Similar data is stored together, leading to better compression ratios
- **Columnar access**: You can read only the columns you need, reducing I/O operations
- **Predicate pushdown**: Filter operations can be pushed down to the storage layer, improving query performance

## Current Integration with AR.IO Gateways

In the current AR.IO gateway implementation, Parquet and ClickHouse run alongside SQLite rather than replacing it. This parallel architecture allows each database to handle what it does best:

- **SQLite** continues to handle transaction writes and updates
- **ClickHouse** with Parquet files is optimized for fast query performance, especially with large datasets

The gateway continues to operate with SQLite just as it always has, maintaining all of its normal functionality. Periodically, the gateway will export batches of data from SQLite to Parquet files, which are then imported into ClickHouse. This batch-oriented approach is much more efficient than attempting to synchronize the databases in real-time, as it leverages Parquet's strength in handling large, immutable data sets.

It's important to note that while Parquet offers more efficient storage and better compression for the data it contains, since it runs alongside SQLite rather than replacing it, the total disk space used by your gateway will increase. You'll effectively be storing much of the same data in two different formats, each optimized for different use cases.

When the ClickHouse integration is enabled, GraphQL queries are primarily routed to the ClickHouse database, taking advantage of its superior query performance for large datasets. This significantly improves response times for complex analytical queries while maintaining the reliability of SQLite for ongoing transaction processing.

## Parquet vs. SQLite in AR.IO Gateways

While SQLite is excellent for transactional workloads and small to medium datasets, it faces challenges with very large datasets:

## Benefits for Gateway Operators

Implementing Parquet and ClickHouse alongside SQLite in your AR.IO gateway offers several key advantages:

- **Dramatically improved query performance** for GraphQL endpoints, especially for large result sets
- **Reduced storage requirements** through efficient columnar compression
- **Better scalability** for growing datasets
- **Faster bootstrapping** of new gateways through Parquet file imports
- **Reduced load on SQLite** by offloading query operations to ClickHouse

The primary focus of the Parquet/ClickHouse integration is the significant speed improvement for querying large datasets. Gateway operators managing significant volumes of data will notice substantial performance gains when using this configuration.

## Storage Considerations

While Parquet files are more storage-efficient for the data they contain (with better compression ratios than SQLite), it's important to understand the total storage impact:

- When running both SQLite and Parquet/ClickHouse together, your overall disk usage will increase, not decrease
- You'll effectively be storing the same data twice, albeit in different formats optimized for different operations
- The storage efficiency within the Parquet format itself is excellent, but this doesn't reduce the total storage footprint of your gateway

For gateway operators, this means ensuring you have adequate disk space to accommodate both database systems. The trade-off is between additional storage requirements and significantly improved query performance for large datasets.

The following sections will guide you through setting up ClickHouse with your AR.IO gateway, exporting data from SQLite to Parquet, and importing Parquet files to bootstrap your ClickHouse database.

<Tip title="Note" type="info">
The below instructions are designed to be used in a linux environment. Windows and MacOS users must modify the instructions to use the appropriate package manager/ command syntax for their platform.

Unless otherwise specified, all commands should be run from the root directory of the gateway.
</Tip>

## Installing ClickHouse

ClickHouse is a powerful, open-source analytical database that excels at handling large datasets and complex queries. It is the tool used by the gateway to integrate with the Parquet format. To integrate ClickHouse with your AR.IO gateway, follow these steps:

It is recommended to use [official pre-compiled deb packages for Debian or Ubuntu](https://clickhouse.com/docs/install#quick-install). Run these commands to install packages:

```bash 
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
curl -fsSL 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/rpm/lts/repodata/repomd.xml.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg

ARCH=$(dpkg --print-architecture)
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg arch=${ARCH}] https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
sudo apt-get update
```

This will verify the installation package from official sources and enable installation via `apt-get`.

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y clickhouse-client
```

This will perform the actual installation of the ClickHouse server and client.

During installation, you will be prompted to set a password for the `default` user. This is required to connect to the ClickHouse server.

Advanced users may also choose to create a designated user account in clickhouse for the gateway to use, but the default gateway configuration will assume the `default` user.

## Configure Gateway to use ClickHouse

Because the gateway will be accessing ClickHouse, host address andthe password for the selected user must be provided. This is done via the `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` environment variable.

Update your .env file with the following:

```bash
CLICKHOUSE_URL="http://clickhouse:8123"
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=<your-password>
```

If you set a specific user account for the gateway to use, you can set the `CLICKHOUSE_USER` environment variable to the username.

```bash
CLICKHOUSE_USER=<your-username>
```

If omitted, the gateway will use the `default` user.

Additionally, The Parquet file provided below contains an unbundled data set that includes all data items uploaded via an ArDrive product, including Turbo. Because of this, it is recommended to include unbundling filters that match, or expand, this configuration.

```bash
ANS104_UNBUNDLE_FILTER='{ "and": [ { "not": { "or": [ { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "Warp" } ] }, { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "Redstone" } ] }, { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "KYVE" } ] }, { "tags": [ { "name": "Bundler-App-Name", "value": "AO" } ] }, { "attributes": { "owner_address": "-OXcT1sVRSA5eGwt2k6Yuz8-3e3g9WJi5uSE99CWqsBs" } }, { "attributes": { "owner_address": "ZE0N-8P9gXkhtK-07PQu9d8me5tGDxa_i4Mee5RzVYg" } }, { "attributes": { "owner_address": "6DTqSgzXVErOuLhaP0fmAjqF4yzXkvth58asTxP3pNw" } } ] } }, { "tags": [ { "name": "App-Name", "valueStartsWith": "ArDrive" } ] } ] }'
ANS104_INDEX_FILTER='{ "tags": [ { "name": "App-Name", "value": "ArDrive-App" } ] }'
```

Lastly, you must have a gateway admin password set. This is used for the periodic export of data from SQLite to Parquet.

```bash
ADMIN_API_KEY=<example>
```

Once the .env file is updated, restart the gateway to apply the changes.

## Downloading the Parquet File

A pre-compiled Parquet file is available for download from [ar://JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM](https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM). This file contains an unbundled data set that includes all data items uploaded via an ArDrive product, current to April 23, 2025, and compressed using tar.gz.

To download the file, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM -o 2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet.tar.gz
```

or visit the url [https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM](https://arweave.net/JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM) and download the file manually.

<Tip title="Note" type="info">
If downloaded manually, it will download as a binary file named `JVmsuD2EmFkhitzWN71oi9woADE4WUfvrbBYgremCBM`. This is normal and must be converted to a tar.gz file by renaming it to `2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet.tar.gz`.

It should also be placed in the root directory of the gateway.
</Tip>

The downloaded file will be approximately 3.5GB in size.

## Extracting and Importing the Parquet File

With the parquet file downloaded and placed in the root directory of the gateway, you can extract the file and import it into ClickHouse.

```bash
tar -xzf 2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet.tar.gz
```

This will extract the file into a directory named `2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet`, and take a while to complete.


Next, if you do not already have a `data/parquet` directory, you must create it. Release 33 does not have this directory by default, but future Releases will. You can create the directory by using the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p data/parquet
```

or by starting the gateway ClickHouse container with the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up clickhouse -d
```

<Tip title="Note" type="info">
Depending on your system configurations, allowing the gateway to create the directory may result in the directory being created with incorrect permissions. If this is the case, you can remove the restrictions by running the following command:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 data/parquet
```
</Tip>

With the directory created, you can now move the extracted parquet files into it.

```bash
mv 2025-04-23-ardrive-ans104-parquet/* data/parquet
```

When this is complete, you can run the import script to import the parquet files into ClickHouse.

If you haven't done so already, start the ClickHouse container with the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up clickhouse -d
```

Then run the import script with the following command:

```bash
./scripts/clickhouse-import
```

This process will take several minutes, and will output the progress of the import.

## Verifying Successful Import

To verify that the import was successful, run the following commands:

```bash
clickhouse client --password <your-password> -h localhost -q 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM transactions'
```

Being sure to replace `<your-password>` with the password you set for the selected ClickHouse user.

This should return a count of the number of unique transactions in the parquet file, which is `32712311`.

You can also verify that the data is being served by the gateway's GraphQL endpoint by ensuring the gateway is not proxying its GraphQL queries (Make sure `GRAPHQL_HOST` is not set) and running the following command:

```bash
curl -g -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"query { transactions(ids: [\"YSNwoYB01EFIzbs6HmkGUjjxHW3xuqh-rckYhi0av4A\"]) { edges { node { block { height } bundledIn { id } } } } }"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/graphql

# Expected output:
# {"data":{"transactions":{"edges":[{"node":{"block":{"height":1461918},"bundledIn":{"id":"ylhb0PqDtG5HwBg00_RYztUl0x2RuKvbNzT6YiNR2JA"}}}]}}}
```

## Starting and Stopping the Gateway with ClickHouse

The gateway ClickHouse container is run as a "profile" in the main docker compose file. That means you must specify the profile when starting or stopping the gateway if you want to include the ClickHouse container in the commands.

To start the gateway with the ClickHouse profile, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up -d
```

This will start all of the containers normally covered by the `docker compose up` command, but will also start the ClickHouse container.

To stop the gateway with the ClickHouse profile, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse down
```

This will stop all of the containers normally covered by the `docker compose down` command, but will also stop the ClickHouse container.

To start or stop only the ClickHouse container, you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse up clickhouse -d
```

and

```bash
docker compose --profile clickhouse down clickhouse
```
