# Importing SQLite Database Snapshots

## Overview

One of the challenges of running an AR.IO Gateway is the initial synchronization time as your gateway builds its local index of the Arweave network. This process can take days or even weeks, depending on your hardware and the amount of data you want to index. To accelerate this process, you can import a pre-synchronized SQLite database snapshot that contains transaction and data item records already indexed.

This guide will walk you through the process of importing a database snapshot into your AR.IO Gateway.

<Tip title="Note" type="info">
The below instructions are designed to be used in a linux environment. Windows and MacOS users must modify the instructions to use the appropriate package manager/ command syntax for their platform.

Unless otherwise specified, all commands should be run from the root directory of the gateway.
</Tip>

## Obtaining a Database Snapshot

SQLite database snapshots are very large and not easy to incrementally update. For these reasons, AR.IO is distributing them using BitTorrent. These snapshots can be downloaded using any preferred torrenting client, and below is instructions on doing so using [transmission-cli](https://github.com/transmission/transmission) from a terminal.

```bash
transmission-cli "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:62ca6e05248e6df59fac9e38252e9c71951294ed&dn=2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=http%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.torrent.eu.org%3A451%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fp4p.arenabg.com%3A1337%2Fannounce&tr=https%3A%2F%2Ftracker.bt4g.com%3A443%2Fannounce"
```

This will download a snapshot, current to April 23, 2025, of an unbundled data set that includes all data items uploaded via an ArDrive product, including Turbo. The file will be named `2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz` and be approximately 42.8Gb in size.

<Tip title="Note" type="info">
While continuing to seed the torrent after download is not required, it is highly recommended to help ensure the continued availability of the snapshot for others, as well as the integrity of the data. Seeding this file should not cause any issues with your internet service provider.
</Tip>

This is a compressed tarball, so it will need to be extracted before it can be used.

## Extracting the Database Snapshot

Once the file has downloaded, you can extract it using the following command, be sure to replace the filename with the actual filename of the snapshot you are using, if not using the example above.

```bash
tar -xzf 2025-04-23-sqlite.tar.gz
```

This will extract the file into a directory matching the filename, minus the `.tar.gz` extension.

## Importing the Database Snapshot

Once you have an extracted database snapshot, you can import it into your AR.IO gateway by replacing the existing SQLite database files. Follow the instructions below to do so.

<Tip title="IMPORTANT" type="info">
Importing a database snapshot will delete your existing database and replace it with the snapshot you are importing.
</Tip>

1. Stop your AR.IO gateway.

```bash
docker compose down
```

2. (Optional) Backup your existing SQLite database files.

```bash
mkdir sqlite-backup
mv data/sqlite/* sqlite-backup/
```

3. Delete the existing SQLite database files.

```bash
rm data/sqlite/*
```

4. Move the snapshot files into the `data/sqlite` directory.

```bash
mv 2025-04-23-sqlite/* data/sqlite/
```
Be sure to replace `2025-04-23-sqlite` with the actual directory name of the extracted snapshot you are using.

5. Start your AR.IO gateway.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Verifying the Import

The simplest way to verify the import is to check the gateway logs to see what block number is being imported. The 2025-04-23 snapshot was taken at block `1645229`, so the gateway will start importing blocks after this height if the snapshot was imported successfully.

You can also use the [Grafana Sidecar](/gateways/grafana) to view the last block imported in a more human readable format.
