# Gateway FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Overview

This guide addresses common questions and issues that gateway operators may encounter while running and maintaining their gateways.

## FAQ

<br />

### Why was my reward different this epoch?

<details>

  <summary>Why was my reward different this epoch?</summary>

  - Gateway protocol rewards are calculated as 0.1% of the protocol balance (0.05% after August 2025) split between all gateways in the network. A change in the protocol balance or the number of gateways in the network between epochs will result in the reward for an individual gateway changing. 

  - The Observer rewards are separate from protocol rewards, and if your gateway is selected as an observer for an epoch, assuming it performs its duties well, it will receive additional rewards
</details>

### I have a high stake on my gateway, why am I not an observer?

<details>

  <summary>I have a high stake on my gateway, why am I not an observer?</summary>

  The observer selection process uses a weighted random selection method that considers multiple factors beyond just stake:

  - **Stake Weight (SW)**: Ratio of your total staked ARIO tokens (including delegated stake) to the network minimum
  - **Tenure Weight (TW)**: How long your gateway has been part of the network (capped at 4 after 2 years)
  - **Gateway Performance Ratio Weight (GPRW)**: Ratio of epochs where you correctly resolved names vs total participation
  - **Observer Performance Ratio Weight (OPRW)**: Ratio of epochs where you successfully submitted reports vs total observer periods

  A composite weight (CW) is calculated as: CW = SW × TW × GPRW × OPRW

  Up to 50 gateways are chosen as observers per epoch. If there are more than 50 gateways, selection is randomized based on these normalized weights. Even with a high stake, other factors like performance and tenure affect your chances of being selected.

### I withdrew my stake, but now I have less

<details>

  <summary>I withdrew my stake, but now I have less</summary>

  - There is a 90 day locking period when withdrawing stake, either from delegated stake or operator stake on your gateway. This locking period can be skipped, for a fee. The fee starts at 50% of the withdrawal amount, and goes down over time. If you selected instant withdrawal, you paid the fee to skip the locking period.
</details>

### Why Can't I withdraw my stake?

<details>

  <summary>Why Can't I withdraw my stake?</summary>

  - The minimum operator stake for gateways (10,000 ARIO) cannot be instantly withdrawn, it is subject to the full 90 day locking period, and withdrawal can only be started by removing your gateway from the network.

## Troubleshooting

<br /> 

### My gateway was working, but it just stopped

<details>

  <summary>My gateway was working, but it just stopped</summary>

  - Visit your gateway in a browser and see if your SSL certs are expired. This is the most common issue causing sudden stops in proper operation.
</details>

### I updated my SSL certs, but it still shows as bad in a browser

<details>

  <summary>I updated my SSL certs, but it still shows as bad in a browser</summary>

  - Try restarting nginx, it sometimes has trouble looking at the new certs without a restart.
</details>

### My gateway won't resolve ArNS names

<details>

  <summary>My gateway won't resolve ArNS names</summary>
  
  - Make sure `ARNS_ROOT_HOST` is properly set in your `.env` file. Updating this requires restarting your gateway.
  - Make sure you have a DNS record set for `*.<your-gateway-domain>`. Since ArNS names are served as subdomains, you need to make sure all subdomains are pointed at your gateway.
  - If your gateway is attempting to resolve the name, but times out, it's most likely a CU issue.
</details>

### I see an error in my logs, but everything appears to be working

<details>

  <summary>I see an error in my logs, but everything appears to be working</summary>
  
  - AR.IO gateways are very robust, they can handle temporary errors gracefully and not affect normal operation. You should only be concerned if the error is consistent or it is causing your gateway to not function properly.
</details>

### I was selected as an observer, but my logs say a report was not saved

<details>

  <summary>I was selected as an observer, but my logs say a report was not saved</summary>

  - Observers generate and submit their reports at specific times throughout the epoch. This is to ensure a healthy network throughout the entire epoch, not just at the start.
  - Your observer wallet must match the observer wallet associated with your gateway in the AR.IO contract. You can check this by navigating to your gateway in ar://gateways.
</details>

### I see an error in my logs that says &lt;h&quot;... is not valid JSON

<details>

  <summary>I see an error in my logs that says &lt;h&quot;... is not valid JSON</summary>

  - This happens when a request to a CU fails, and your gateway receives an html failure message instead of the expected JSON response. This will normally clear up on its own after congestion on that CU dies down, but if it is persistent try switching to a different CU.
</details>

### My gateway logs just changed, instead of importing blocks I see "polling for block"

<details>

  <summary>My gateway logs just changed, instead of importing blocks I see "polling for block"</summary>

  - This is normal. It means you have reached the current Arweave block and need to wait for more before you can index them.
</details>

### Error resolving name with resolver Promise timed out

<details>

  <summary>Error resolving name with resolver Promise timed out</summary>

  - This is normal. If a gateway fails to resolve an arns name within 3 seconds, it will fall back to a trusted gateway (arweave.net by default) to help resolve the name.
</details>

### My gateway failed an epoch

<details>

  <summary>My gateway failed an epoch</summary>

  - There are many reasons a gateway could fail an epoch. Following these steps is usually enough to identify and correct the issue:
    - Try to visit your gateway in a browser and see if your SSL certs are bad
    - Try to resolve an ArNS name on your gateway. If it fails to resolve, check the console and your gateway logs for errors
    - Look at the observation reports that failed your gateway, they will list the reason for failure
